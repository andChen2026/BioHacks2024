breast cancer\n\n  * Prior chemotherapy in the adjuvant or metastatic setting is not required\n  * Any number of prior neoadjuvant or adjuvant chemotherapy regimens allowed\n  * Prior treatment with high-dose chemotherapy and autologous stem cell or bone marrow transplantation is considered 1 regimen when administered for metastatic disease (including induction chemotherapy and preparative regimen)\n* May have had stable or responding disease on prior nonsteroidal aromatase inhibitors (e.g., letrozole, anastrozole, or aminogluthemide)\n\n  * Any prior aromatase inhibitor-related toxicity \u2265 grade 3 must have resolved \u2265 4 weeks before the start of study treatment\n* May have had disease progression on other prior hormonal therapy (e.g., selective estrogen receptor modulators \\[SERMs\\], receptor downregulators \\[SERDs\\], or ovarian suppression) in the adjuvant or metastatic setting\n* No history or evidence of primary brain tumor or brain metastases by CT scan or MRI\n* Must have estrogen receptor- and/or progesterone receptor-positive tumor\n\nPATIENT CHARACTERISTICS:\n\n* Rendered postmenopausal with ovarian suppression (ovarian suppression with a depot LH-RH agonist allowed) prior to the start of study treatment OR is already postmenopausal, as defined by 1 of the criteria:\n\n  * No spontaneous menses for \u2265 12 months if the patient is \u2265 50 years old\n  * Amenorrheic for \u2265 12 months if the patient is \\< 50 years old, with serum estradiol and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) levels within the institutional postmenopausal range\n  * Bilateral oophorectomy\n\n    * At least 28 days since surgical oophorectomy\n  * Patients who have had prior hysterectomy but intact ovaries must be \u2265 55 years old, or have serum

requirement for IV alimentation\n* No significant traumatic injury within the past 28 days\n* No psychiatric illness or social situation that would preclude study compliance\n* No other uncontrolled intercurrent illness\n\nPRIOR CONCURRENT THERAPY:\n\n* See Disease Characteristics\n* No prior steroidal aromatase inhibitors (e.g., exemestane) unless administered in the adjuvant setting (not for metastatic disease) and \u2265 12 months have elapsed since last treatment\n* Any number of prior immunotherapies (e.g., trastuzumab \\[Herceptin\\^\u00ae\\] or vaccines) in the adjuvant or metastatic setting allowed\n* More than 3 weeks since prior chemotherapy (6 weeks for nitrosoureas or mitomycin C)\n* More than 3 weeks since prior radiotherapy\n* More than 3 weeks since prior immunotherapy\n*

suppression\n* No prior surgical procedures affecting absorption\n* More than 28 days since prior major surgery or open biopsy\n* At least 24 hours since prior placement of indwelling catheters\n* At least 10 days since prior and no concurrent full-dose oral or parenteral anticoagulants or thrombolytic agents except as required to maintain patency of preexisting, permanent indwelling IV catheters\n\n  * Patients receiving warfarin should have INR \\< 1.5\n* No prior bevacizumab\n* No other prior KDR inhibitors (e.g., vascular endothelial growth factor \\[VEGF\\] Trap, SU5416, SU6668,
