The patient must be willing to undergo a new tumor biopsy at screening and during treatment.\n\nECOG performance status 0-2 and in the opinion of the investigator, likely to complete at least 56 days of treatment.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\nSymptomatic or uncontrolled Brain metastases requiring concurrent treatment, inclusive of but not limited to surgery, radiation and/or corticosteroids.\n\nPatients with treated symptomatic brain metastases should be neurologically stable for 4 weeks post-treatment prior to study entry and at doses of \\<10 mg per day prednisolone or equivalent for at least 2 weeks before administration of any study treatment.\n\nPatients who required discontinuation of treatment due to treatment-related toxicities with prior immunotherapy.\n\nPatients previously treated with anti-CD73 treatment and/or adenosine receptor A2a (A2aR) inhibitors.\n\nActive, previously documented, or suspected autoimmune disease within the past 2 years.\n\nPatients with vitiligo, type I diabetes, residual hypothyroidism only requiring hormone replacement, psoriasis not requiring systemic treatment or conditions not expected to recur should not be excluded. Additionally, patients previously exposed to anti-PD-1/PD-L1 treatment who are adequately treated for skin rash or with replacement therapy for endocrinopathies should not be excluded.\n\nHistory of or current drug-induced interstitial lung disease or pneumonitis grade \u2265 2.\n\nImpaired cardiovascular function or clinically significant cardiovascular disease, including any of the following: Clinically significant and/or uncontrolled heart disease such as congestive heart failure requiring treatment (NYHA Grade \u2265 2), uncontrolled hypertension or clinically significant arrhythmia Patients with corrected QT using the Fridericia's correction (QTcF) \\> 470 msec for females or \\>450 msec for males, on screening ECG or congenital long QT syndrome Acute myocardial infarction or unstable angina \\< 3 months prior to study entry History of stroke or transient ischemic event requiring medical therapy Symptomatic claudication Infection: HIV infection, Active HBV or HCV infection (per institutional guidelines).

Patients requiring systemic antibiotics for infection must have completed treatment before screening is initiated.\n\nSystemic anti-cancer therapy within 2 weeks of the first dose of study treatment. For cytotoxic agents that have major delayed toxicity, e.g. mitomycin C and nitrosoureas, 6 weeks is indicated as washout period. For patients receiving anticancer immunotherapies, 4 weeks is indicated as the washout period.\n\nSystemic chronic steroid therapy (\u2265 10 mg/day prednisone or equivalent) or any immunosuppressive therapy, other than replacement dose steroids in the setting of adrenal insufficiency, within 7 days of the first dose of study treatment. Topical, inhaled, nasal, and ophthalmic steroids are allowed\n\nOther protocol-defined inclusion/exclusion criteria may apply",
