Any liver lesion targeted for injection must not exceed 50 mm at the time of injection.\n* Demonstrated adequate organ function within 14 days of Cycle 1 Day 1 (C1D1).\n\nKey Exclusion Criteria:\n\n* Use of an investigational agent or an investigational device within 21 days before administration of first dose of study drug(s).\n* Patients treated with prior interleukin-2 (IL-2).\n* Patients who have been previously treated with a toll-like receptor (TLR) agonist (excluding topical agents) and patients who have received experimental cancer vaccines.\n* Patients who have received systemic interferon (IFN)\u03b1 within the previous 6 months prior to enrollment to the study.\n* Other active malignancy, except non-melanomic skin cancer\n* Evidence of clinically significant interstitial lung disease or active, noninfectious pneumonitis.\n* Prior surgery or radiotherapy within 14 days of initiating study drug(s).
