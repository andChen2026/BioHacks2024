Endometrial carcinoma will not be selected for any molecular status.\n* Phase II: Patients with advanced/metastatic solid tumors, with at least one measurable lesion as determined by modified RECIST version 1.1, who progressed despite standard therapy or be intolerant of standard therapy, or for whom no standard therapy exists, fitting in one of the following groups: Group 1: patients with PIK3CA mutated or amplified ER positive (ER+) breast cancer ; Group 2: patients with endometrial carcinoma (not selected for any molecular status); Group 3: patients with solid tumors (with the exception of PIK3CA mutant/amplified ER+ breast cancer and endometrial carcinoma) harboring PIK3CA mutation or amplification/any PTEN status; Group 4: patients with solid tumors (with the exception of endometrial carcinoma) harboring PTEN loss of function/ PIK3CA wild type; Group 5: non-small cell lung cancer harboring cMET activation and/or EGFR mutation. Up to 3 lines of chemotherapy allowed in advanced/metastatic setting.\n* ECOG Performance Status \u2264 2.\n* Availability of a representative formalin fixed paraffin embedded tumor tissue sample.
