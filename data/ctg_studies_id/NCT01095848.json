    "primaryPurpose": "TREATMENT",
    "enrollmentCount": 23,
    "primaryOutcomeMeasure": "To determine the safety profile of two different doses of subcutaneously administered DPX-0907. Safety assessments will be based on reported adverse events and the results of vital sign measurements, physical examinations, and clinical laboratory tests.",
    "eligibilityCriteria": "Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Patients with stage III or IV ovarian cancer who have completed a course of platinin-based cytotoxic therapy after debulking surgery with evidence of a complete or partial response by radiological imaging. Patients with metastatic ovarian cancer who have stable disease for greater than 3 months after completion of first-line therapy.\n* Patients with stage IV breast cancer who have received at least 1 course of hormonal or cytotoxic therapy for metastatic cancer. Patients must be off cytotoxic therapy with stable disease or better for 3 months or greater duration. Patients may have stable disease and still be on hormonal therapy.\n* Patients with prostate cancer who have failed at least 1 course of an accepted hormonal therapy. Specifically prostate cancer patients must have castrate testosterone levels (\\< 50 ng/dl) and 2 PSA values higher than the previously documented baseline at least 3 weeks apart or evidence of increases in measurable disease. These patients may have received previous courses of cytotoxic chemotherapy although chemotherapy na\u00efve patients who are deemed not good candidates or who have refused cytotoxic therapy will be eligible. These patients may remain on anti-androgen therapy during the trial. Patients with evidence of progressive bone or other metastases are acceptable.\n* At least 8 weeks since previous courses of an investigational biologic therapy (i.e. cancer vaccine) including active or passive immunotherapy.\n* At least 30 days since localized surgery or radiotherapy.\n* At least 30 days since initiation of a biphosphonate treatment.\n* HLA A2 haplotype.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* History of autoimmune disease, such as inflammatory bowel disease, systemic lupus erythematosus, ankylosing spondylitis, scleroderma, or multiple sclerosis. Patients with a remote history (greater than five years) of thyroiditis are not excluded.\n* Presence of an acute infection requiring antibiotics within 4 weeks of study entry or a chronic infection such as: urinary tract infection, HIV, or antigen positive viral hepatitis.\n* Previously resected brain metastases unless a CT or MRI scan of the brain shows no metastasis within 1 month of receiving DPX-0907.\n* Concurrent (within the last 5 years) second malignancy other than non-melanoma skin cancer, cervical carcinoma in situ, or controlled bladder cancer.\n* Acute or chronic skin disorders that will interfere with subcutaneous injection of the vaccine or subsequent assessment of potential skin reactions.\n* Serious intercurrent chronic or acute illness, such as cardiac disease (NYHA class III or IV) or hepatic disease.\n* Steroid therapy or other immunosuppressives, such as azathioprine or cyclosporin A, unless steroids are discontinued 6 weeks prior to study.\n* Allergies to any component of the vaccine.\n* Inability to gain venous access.\n* Previous splenectomy.\n* Previous lymphadenectomy in both inguinal regions.\n* Pregnant or nursing mothers.\n* Medical or psychological impediment or active drug or alcohol use that might preclude protocol compliance.",
