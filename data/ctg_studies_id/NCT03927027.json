If ALND is performed during a separate operation, ARM procedure must be repeated. Clinically node negative is defined by i) negative clinical exam and/or ii) negative axillary US and/or iii) negative needle biopsy of sonographically suspicious axillary nodes as applicable to each case.\n  * Clinically node positive patients as determined by needle biopsy and planned for ALND regardless of type of breast surgery.\n  * Patients will be staged according to the TNM staging system.\n* Prior Treatment: No prior axillary surgery except needle biopsy or concurrent SLNB.\n\n  o Prior neoadjuvant chemotherapy is allowed but must be completed at least 2 weeks before registration.\n* No prior history of ipsilateral breast cancer (invasive or ductal breast carcinoma in situ \\[DCIS\\]). Lobular breast carcinoma in situ (LCIS) and benign disease are allowed. (May have neoadjuvant chemotherapy which must be completed 2 weeks before registration).\n* No bilateral invasive breast cancer.\n* No matted nodes.\n* No history of lymphedema of either arm.\n* No known allergies blue dyes, including make-up containing blue dye.\n* In order to complete the mandatory patient-completed measures, participants must be able to speak and/or read English.\n* Female :\n\nMen are excluded from this study because the number of men with breast cancer is insufficient to provide a statistical basis for assessment of effects in this subpopulation of people with breast cancer.\n\n* Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 0, 1 or 2.\n* Creatinine: =\\< 1.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN).",
