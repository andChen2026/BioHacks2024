The patient must have recovered from the side effects of the prior treatment including prior drug-induced peripheral neuropathy.\n* Patients who have received prior taxane therapy will be eligible. (However, patients who have progressed within 6 months of receiving docetaxel will be excluded.)\n* A minimum of 28 days must have elapsed from the completion of any prior chemotherapy or radiation treatment.\n* Patients who are currently receiving bisphosphonates for bone disease will be allowed to enter the trial, however their bone lesions will not be considered assessable for response, but will be assessable for progression.\n* Initiation of bisphosphonate treatment during the trial will be discouraged but allowed in the absence of progressive disease. If bisphosphonates are initiated, then bone lesions will be assessed for progression only.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Other serious illnesses, which would limit survival to \\<2 months, or a psychiatric condition, which would prevent compliance with treatment or informed consent.\n* ECOG Performance Status \\>2\n* Anticipated survival \\< 2 months\n* Uncontrolled or severe cardiovascular disease, diabetes, pulmonary disease, or infection, which in the opinion of the treating physician would make this protocol treatment unreasonably hazardous for the patient.\n* Patients with a \"currently active\" second malignancy other than non-melanoma skin cancers. Patients are not considered to have a \"currently active\" malignancy if they have completed therapy and considered by their physician to be at less than 30% risk of relapse within one year.\n* Patients who have received any investigational agent within the prior 4 weeks.\n* Age \\< 18 as there is no safety data for lovastatin in this age range.\n* Patients with a history of severe hypersensitivity reaction to Taxotere\u00ae or other drugs formulated with polysorbate 80.\n* Patients who have received anticancer endocrine therapy within 4 weeks prior to registration are not eligible.\n* Patients currently on daily statin therapy will also be excluded.\n* Patients who have progressed within 6 months of receiving docetaxel are not eligible.\n* Treatment with the anti-emetic Aprepitant is not allowed.\n* Patients who are currently receiving , or have received Herceptin therapy within 4 weeks prior to registration are not eligible.\n* Pregnant and/or Nursing.
