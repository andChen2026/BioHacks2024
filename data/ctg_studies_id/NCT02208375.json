patients found to have a fasting glucose \\>= 7 mmol/L (\\>= 126 mg/dL) or glycosylated hemoglobin \\> 8% (64 mmol/mol) at screening should be assessed for appropriate management according to local policy; those in whom dietary measures alone provide good diabetic control will be eligible for inclusion; type I or II diabetes mellitus requiring either insulin or oral hypoglycemics for routine management will be excluded\n* Patients must be able to swallow and tolerate oral medications and not have gastrointestinal illnesses that would preclude absorption of AZD2014, AZD5363, or olaparib (e.g. uncontrolled nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea; malabsorption syndrome; ulcerative disease)\n* Participants' life expectancy must be \\> 4 months\n* Patients must be able to understand and willing to sign an informed consent\n* FOR EXPANSION PHASE ONLY: For the expansion phase, patients must have measurable disease accessible for biopsy\n* FOR EXPANSION PHASE ONLY: For the expansion phase, patients must have archival specimens from the time of primary or recurrence diagnosis\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Patients receiving any other investigational agents or any additional anti-cancer agents\n* Patients who have endometrial carcinosarcoma;
