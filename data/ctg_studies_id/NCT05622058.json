Presence of distant metastases. Nodal involvement is acceptable.\n* Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including but not limited to:\n\n  * Clinically significant, active, uncontrolled infection including human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), or hepatitis B or C\n\n    * Patients with HIV must be on effective antiretroviral therapy for \u2265 4 weeks prior to enrollment and have HIV viral load \\< 400 copies/mL, have had no acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS)-defining opportunistic infections in the past 12 months, and have CD4+ count \u2265 350 cells/\u03bcL.\n    * Patients with chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) must be on antiviral therapy and have HBV viral load below the limits of detection.\n    * Patients with hepatitis C virus (HCV) must be on or have completed antiviral therapy and have an HCV viral load below the limits of detection.\n  * Uncontrolled hypertension\n  * Uncontrolled diabetes mellitus\n* Clinically unstable cardiac disease, including unstable atrial fibrillation, symptomatic bradycardia, unstable congestive heart failure, active myocardial ischemia, or indwelling temporary pacemaker.\n* Pregnant or lactating women.\n* Hereditary angioedema of any severity or severe or life-threatening angioedema due to any cause.\n* Treatment with an investigational agent for any indication within the shorter of 14 days or 5 half-lives, if the half-life is known.\n* The required use of any concomitant medications that are predominantly cleared by hepatobiliary transporters, OATP members OATP1B1 and OATP1B3, on the day of the first ALRN-6924 infusion to within 48 hours after the last ALRN-6924 infusion in a treatment cycle. This criterion does not apply to the patients in the control group.\n* Other medications, severe acute/chronic medical or psychiatric condition, or laboratory abnormality that may increase the risk associated with study participation or study drug administration, or may interfere with the interpretation of study results, and in the judgment of the investigator would make the patient inappropriate for entry into this study.\n* Clinically evident alopecia of any grade at screening.",
