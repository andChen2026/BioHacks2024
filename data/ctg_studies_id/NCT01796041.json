Women with newly diagnosed, operable invasive ductal carcinoma, invasive lobular carcinoma or ductal carcinoma who are deemed breast conservation surgery candidates (i.e. lumpectomy +/- sentinel node biopsy).\n3. Breast cancer needs to be unifocal as determined by clinical parameters, e.g. by palpation or by breast imaging findings including mammogram, US and/or breast MRI. Multifocal disease, i.e. cancer confined to one quadrant, is eligible if patients are deemed breast conservation candidates.\n4. Subject capable of giving informed consent and participating in the process of consent.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n1. Newly diagnosed breast cancer patients who are not breast conservation candidates and those with multicentric breast cancer (breast cancer documented in multiple quadrants by breast imaging or exam)\n2. Pregnant women as determined by urinary or serum beta human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) within 72 hours of surgery\n3. Subjects with a history of iodide allergies\n4. At-risk patient populations\n\n   1. Homeless patients\n   2. Patients with drug or alcohol dependence\n   3. Patients unable to participate in the consent process",
