Single, discrete, well-defined primary tumor.\n4. Any micro-calcifications must be focal. A specimen radiograph is required after lumpectomy to assure removal of all malignant appearing calcifications.\n5. Pathologically negative surgical margins.\n6. Axillary lymph node status can be determined by level I and II lymph node dissection or sentinel lymph node sampling.\n7. ECOG performance status 0-2.\n\nContraindications:\n\n1. Multicentric disease and/or diffuse malignant appearing microcalcifications.\n2. Evidence of metastatic breast cancer.\n3. Axillary lymph node involvement.\n4. Pre-existing collagen vascular disease except rheumatoid arthritis that does not require immunosuppressive therapy.\n5. Prior irradiation to the ara of planned radiation field.\n6.
