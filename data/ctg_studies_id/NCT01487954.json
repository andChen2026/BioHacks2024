    "eligibilityCriteria": "Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Patients must have histologically or cytologically confirmed stage 0-IV breast cancer and have a treatment plan consisting of 62Gy (31 fractions) of total breast radiation therapy to be eligible; patients are eligible if they have received any number of prior chemotherapies; patients having received chemotherapy prior to radiation will be stratified among randomization groups during the second phase of this study\n* Life expectancy of greater than 3 months\n* Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status =\\< 2 (Karnofsky \\>= 60%)\n* Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Patients receiving any investigational chemotherapeutic agents during planned radiation or any prior breast or chest wall radiation treatments are excluded\n* Patients receiving concurrent chemotherapy are excluded because of an increased relative risk of skin toxicity; patients taking daily proton-pump inhibitor or H2-blocker antacid medications are excluded because of predicted interference of alkaline water consumption and stomach pH; herceptin for the purposes of this clinical trial would be considered a chemotherapy, and as such, patients receiving herceptin chemotherapy during radiation would not be eligible for participation in this protocol\n* Patients with a history of any prior malignancy except non-melanoma skin cancer or carcinoma in-situ of the cervix not in remission for twelve months are excluded; patients with known brain metastases are excluded from this clinical trial because of their overall poor prognosis\n* Pregnancy excludes female patients from this study because radiation is potentially teratogenic and abortifacient; screening beta-hcg levels and clinically-indicated diagnostic tests will be used to determine eligibility",
