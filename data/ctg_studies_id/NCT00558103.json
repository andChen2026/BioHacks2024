    "eligibilityCriteria": "Inclusion criteria:\n\nSpecific information regarding warnings, precautions, contraindications, adverse events, and other pertinent information on the investigational product that may impact patient eligibility is provided in the pazopanib IB and lapatinib prescribing information (or the lapatinib IB).\n\nFor Cohort 1 of this study, eligible patients met inclusion criteria outlined in the original version of the protocol and protocol amendment 1.\n\nFor Cohort 2 of this study, eligible patients must meet all of the following criteria:\n\n* Patients must have evaluable Inflammatory Breast Cancer (IBC) substantiated by all of the following prior to randomization:\n* History of invasive breast cancer documented by a biopsy and accompanying pathology report\n* Current photographs\\* (global view and close-up views of all skin lesions) submitted at screening demonstrating unequivocal evidence of IBC as determined by either the medical monitor alone or in consultation with one or more of the study Principal Investigators.\n* All patients must have photography at screening. Canfield Scientific Inc. will provide centralized monitoring, tracking, and collection of patients' photographs throughout the study. Screening photographs must be uploaded to the Canfield Scientific Inc website and approved by Canfield Scientific Inc, as the central photography vendor. The photographs, along with the completed Inflammatory Breast Cancer Skin Assessment Tool (IBSAT), must be reviewed and approved by GSK before a patient can be randomized. Sites should allow a minimum of 3 business days for this process. Sites submitting quality photographs and IBSATs on a regular basis will receive an exemption from this requirement for future patients.\n* Patients with secondary IBC are eligible.\n* Measurable lesions (cutaneous or radiographic) may be in the field of prior standard or palliative radiation therapy; however, there must be at least a 4 week period between the last radiation treatment and the baseline scan documenting disease status for the lesion to be measurable. If the irradiated lesion is the only site of disease, documented progression of the irradiated lesion is required.\n* Disease progression or relapse following treatment for invasive breast cancer, which must have included a chemotherapy regimen. In regions where trastuzumab is available with no barriers to access\\*, patients must have received prior trastuzumab in addition to chemotherapy in order to be eligible. \\* (Barriers to access may include financial considerations.)\n* Unequivocal ErbB2 overexpressing breast cancer, defined as 3+ staining by immunohistochemistry (IHC), or 2+ staining by IHC in conjunction with ErbB2 gene amplification by FISH/CISH, or ErbB2 gene amplification by FISH/CISH alone (in subjects whose tumor blocks were not assessed by IHC). ErbB2 gene amplification is defined by: \\> six (6) ErbB2 gene copies/nucleus for test systems without an internal control probe or an ErbB2/CEP 17 ratio of more than 2.2.\n\nSites must submit a copy of the laboratory report demonstrating unequivocal ErbB2 overexpression, if testing performed at a local laboratory, with the screening worksheet. Archived tumor must be provided for all patients for ErbB2 FISH testing by the central laboratory. Patients will remain on study based on local ErbB2 expression results. If archived tumor is not available, a biopsy must be obtained at screening and sent to TMD Laboratories for ErbB2 FISH testing.\n\n- Patients must provide written informed consent prior to performance of study-specific procedures or assessments, and must be willing to comply with treatment and follow up. Procedures conducted as part of the patient's routine clinical management (e.g., blood count, imaging study) and obtained prior to signing of informed consent may be utilized for screening or baseline purposes provided these procedures are conducted as specified in the protocol.\n\nNote: Informed consent may be obtained prior to the protocol-specified screening window (i.e. Day -14 to Day -1).\n\n* Females age \u2265 18 years, except in Tunisia. In Tunisia, patients must be \u2265 20 years to be eligible for this study.\n* Adequate organ function as defined below:\n* System (Laboratory Values)\n* Hematologic:Absolute neutrophil count (ANC)(\u2265 1.5 X 10\\^9/L)Hemoglobin1(\u22659 g/dL)Platelets(\u2265100 X 10\\^9/L)International normalized ratio (INR)(\u2264 1.2 X upper limit of normal (ULN))Partial thromboplastin time (PTT)(\u22641.2 X ULN)\n* Hepatic:Total bilirubin2 (\u2264 1.5 X upper limit of normal (ULN))AST and ALT(\u2264 2.5 X ULN)\n* Renal:Serum Creatinine (\u2264 1.5 mg/dL)Or, if serum creatinine \\>1.5 mg/dL,\n* Calculated creatinine clearance(\u226550 mL/min)\n* Urine Protein to Creatinine Ratio(\\<1)\n* Patients may not have had a transfusion within 7 days of screening assessment.\n* Exception: Patients with elevated bilirubin levels due to Gilberts syndrome are eligible.\n* Cardiac ejection fraction within the institutional range of normal as measured by echocardiogram. MUGA scans will be accepted in cases where an echocardiogram cannot be performed or is inconclusive or where MUGA scans are the accepted standard. Patients with known history of uncontrolled or symptomatic angina, arrhythmias, or congestive heart failure are not eligible.\n* Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0-2.\n* A female is eligible to enter and participate in this study if she is of:\n\nNon-childbearing potential (i.e., physiologically incapable of becoming pregnant), including any female who has had:\n\n* A hysterectomy\n* A bilateral oophorectomy (ovariectomy)\n* A bilateral tubal ligation\n* Is post-menopausal\n* Patients not using hormone replacement therapy (HRT) must have experienced total cessation of menses for \u2265 1 year and be greater than 45 years in age, OR, in questionable cases, have a follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) value \\>40 mIU/mL and an estradiol value \\< 40pg/mL (\\<140 pmol/L).\n\nPatients must discontinue HRT prior to study enrollment due to the potential for inhibition of CYP enzymes that metabolize estrogens and progestins (See Section 8). For most forms of HRT, at least 2-4 weeks must elapse between the cessation of HRT and determination of menopausal status; length of this interval depends on the type and dosage of HRT. If a female patient is determined not to be post-menopausal, they must use adequate contraception, as defined immediately below.\n\nChildbearing potential, including any female who has had a negative serum pregnancy test within 2 weeks prior to the first dose of study treatment, preferably as close to the first dose as possible, has used adequate contraception since the pregnancy test and agrees to use adequate contraception as described below. GSK acceptable contraceptive methods, when used consistently and in accordance with both the product label and the instructions of the physician, are as follow:\n\n* An intrauterine device with a documented failure rate of less than 1% per year.\n* Vasectomized partner who is sterile prior to the female patient's entry and is the sole sexual partner for that female.\n* Complete abstinence from sexual intercourse for 14 days before exposure to investigational product, through the dosing period, and for at least 21 days after the last dose of investigational product.\n* Double-barrier contraception (condom with spermicidal jelly, foam suppository, or film; diaphragm with spermicide; or male condom and diaphragm with spermicide).\n\nNote: Oral contraceptives are not reliable due to potential drug drug interactions.\n\nFemale patients who are lactating should discontinue nursing prior to the first dose of investigational product and should refrain from nursing throughout the treatment period and for 14 days following the last dose of investigational product.\n\n- French patients: In France, a patient will be eligible for inclusion in this study only if either affiliated to or a beneficiary of a social security category.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Patients meeting any of the following criteria must not be enrolled in the study:\n* Treatment in the 14 days prior to randomization with any cancer therapy (tumor embolization, chemotherapy, immunotherapy, biological therapy, or hormonal therapy) or treatment with mitomycin within 6 weeks prior to randomization.
