Ii) HBV DNA must be obtained in patients with positive hepatitis B core antibody prior start of study treatment.\n* Patients positive for HCV antibody are eligible only if PCR is negative for HCV RNA\n* Adequate cardiac functions as assessed by echocardiography\n* Adequate birth control measures\n* Signed informed consent\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Patients with active or chronic hepatitis B (defined as having a positive hepatitis B surface antigen \\[HBsAg\\] test at pre-screening)\n* Patients with active hepatitis C\n* Any known formal contra-indication for video-assisted thoracoscopy (VATS) according to pulmonary and cardiac preliminary investigations.\n* Systemic cytotoxic anticancer treatment within 10 days before and after enrolment except for inhibitors of vascular endothelial growth factor for which this period should be decided according to the used drug (for bevacizumab the period involves 4 weeks before and after enrolment, for lenvatinib 1 week before and 2 weeks after, and for sorafenib 1 week before and after), no limitations applied for immune checkpoint inhibitors\n* Major surgery within 28 days prior to enrolment\n* Any unresolved toxicity from previous anticancer therapy of grade \u22652 according to the CTCAE except for alopecia, vitiligo, and laboratory values considered as adequate in the inclusion criteria and any irreversible toxicity that is expected to have impact on the study results or be a contraindication for the planned surgical intervention or be worsened by the investigational procedure\n* Long lasting exposure to corticosteroids\n* Known allergy to platinum compounds\n* Non-small cell lung cancer with egfr or alk mutations unless refractory to tyrosine kinase inhibitor (thus off treatment)\n* Uncontrolled intercurrent illness\n* Clinically relevant hearing loss or tinnitus\n* Clinically relevant neuropathy\n* Life-threatening conditions (uncontrolled systemic infection etc.)\n* Previous administration (by any route) of a total cumulative dose of more than 500 mg/m2 of cisplatin\n* Secondary resistance to platinum compounds defined as tumour progression during platinum treatment or within 6 months after its cessation\n* pregnancy\n* judgement of the investigator that the patient is unlikely to comply with the study requirements\n* current enrolment in another prospective clinical trial\n* Incapacity of judgement\n* Patients in emergency situation\n* Myelossupression\n* Yellow fever vaccine\n* Concurrent prophylactic use of phenytoin",
