Prior to enrolment in the Phase II part of the study, subjects must have ErbB2 over-expression confirmed by a central laboratory,\n* Subjects with stable CNS metastases or leptomeningeal involvement are eligible only if they are not taking oral steroids or enzyme-inducing anticonvulsants. Subjects with CNS only disease will not be allowed.\n* Subjects that received prior radiotherapy must have completed radiotherapy treatment at least 4 weeks before enrolment and recovered from all treatment-related toxicities.\n* Subjects must have new or archived tumour tissue available prior to study entry to evaluate levels of relevant biomarkers.\n* Subjects must have a cardiac ejection fraction within the institutional range of normal as measured by Multigated Acquisition (MUGA) scan or echocardiogram (ECHO).\n* Subjects must have adequate haematological, hepatic, and renal function. Haemoglobin \u22659gm/dL Absolute granulocyte count \u22651500/mm\u00b3 (1.5 x 10\\^9/L) Platelets \u226575,000/mm\u00b3 (75 x 10\\^9/L) Total bilirubin \u22641.5mg/dL Both ALT and AST \u22641.5 times the upper limit of the normal range (ULN) and alkaline phosphatase \u22642.5 times the ULN (See Taxotere Data Sheet) Serum creatinine \u2264 2.0mg/dL or calculated creatinine clearance (CrCl) \u226540mL/min according to the formula of Cockcroft and Gault\n* Subjects who received a taxane as part of adjuvant or neoadjuvant therapy are eligible if they had progression of their disease more than 6 months after completion of treatment.\n* Subjects who received prior ErbB inhibitors in the adjuvant setting will be allowed, but a disease-free interval of at least 6 months must be demonstrated after the end of therapy.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Subject has peripheral neuropathy of grade 2 or higher;\n* Subject has had prior systemic therapy (except one line of hormonal therapy) for metastatic disease. Also, any subjects with prior chemotherapy in the adjuvant or neoadjuvant setting with anthracycline or anthracenedione-containing regimens with cumulative doses of \u2265360mg/m\u00b2 of doxorubicin, \u2265720mg/m\u00b2 of epirubicin, or \u226572mg/m\u00b2 of mitoxantrone;\n* Subjects with prior systemic investigational drugs within the past 30 days or topical investigational drugs within the past 7 days;\n* Subjects with uncontrolled or symptomatic angina, arrhythmias, or congestive heart failure;\n* Subjects with a known immediate or delayed hypersensitivity or untoward reaction to docetaxel, trastuzumab, or other related compounds, or to drugs chemically related to lapatinib.
