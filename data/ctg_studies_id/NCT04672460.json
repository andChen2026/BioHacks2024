    "eligibilityCriteria": "Inclusion Criteria\n\n1. Histological diagnosis of recurrent, locally advanced or metastatic solid tumor that is not amenable for treatment with curative intent.\n\n   * Solid tumors with known or likely pathogenic germline or somatic tumor gene defect (eg, one or more BRCA1 or BRCA2 gene defect except for ovarian cancer) that would benefit from PARPi therapy per current approvals for the tumor indication or supported by strong scientific evidence.\n   * Received at least 1 prior SOC regimen, if it exists, as appropriate for the respective tumor type unless deemed unsuitable or declined these therapies; ovarian cancer participants must have at least 1 prior cytotoxic chemotherapy regimen, including at least 1 course of platinum-based therapy. Participants must not have had disease progression within 6 months of initiation of platinum containing regimen.\n2. ECOG performance score of 0-1.\n3. Adequate bone marrow function:\n\n   * ANC \u22651500 cells/mm3\n   * Platelets \u2265100,000 cells/mm3\n   * Hemoglobin \u226510.0 g/dL\n4. Adequate organ functions:\n\n   * CLCR \u226560 mL/min and no documented CLCR \\<60 mL/min and no change in CLCR \\>25% in the past 4 weeks\n   * AST and ALT \u22642.5 \u00d7 ULN; if liver function abnormalities are due to hepatic metastasis, then AST and ALT \u22645 \u00d7 ULN;\n   * Total bilirubin \u22641.5 \u00d7 ULN (\u22643 \u00d7 ULN for Gilbert's syndrome);\n\nExclusion Criteria\n\n1. For ovarian participants: Non-epithelial tumors or ovarian tumors with low malignant potential (ie, borderline tumors) or mucinous tumors.\n2. Toxicities from previous anti-cancer therapies must be resolved to NCI CTCAE \\<Grade 2, except for alopecia, sensory neuropathies \u2264Grade 2, or other Grade \u22642 AEs not constituting a safety risk, based on investigator's judgment, are acceptable.\n3. Diagnosed with MDS or AML.\n4. Active infection requiring systemic therapy within 2 weeks of enrollment.\n5. Any condition in which active bleeding or pathological conditions may carry a high risk of bleeding (eg, known bleeding disorder, coagulopathy or tumor involvement with major vessels).\n6. Known or suspected brain metastasis or active leptomeningeal disease undergoing or requiring treatment. Asymptomatic brain metastases currently not undergoing treatment are allowed.\n7. Known history of testing positive for HIV, AIDS, positive HBV surface antigen, positive HCV RNA, or positive COVID-19 viral test. Asymptomatic patients with no active infection detected but positive antibody tests, indicating past infection, are allowed.\n8. Current or anticipated use of P-gp inhibitors, BCRP inhibitors, and P-gp inducers within 2 weeks or 5 half-lives prior to randomization (whichever is longer) .",
