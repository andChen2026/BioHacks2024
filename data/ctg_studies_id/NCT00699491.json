Note: brain metastases are not permitted on study unless the metastases have been treated by surgery or radiotherapy, and the patient has been neurologically stable and off of steroids for \\>= 12 weeks\n* Known human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive patients who have cluster of differentiation (CD)4 counts below the normal range or who are on anti-retroviral therapy that may interfere with the metabolism of temsirolimus\n* Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to:\n\n  * Ongoing or active infection\n  * Symptomatic congestive heart failure\n  * Unstable angina pectoris\n  * Uncontrolled symptomatic cardiac arrhythmia\n  * Psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements\n* Receiving enzyme-inducing antiepileptic drugs (EIAEDs;
