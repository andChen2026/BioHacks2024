Patients may have either measurable or non-measurable disease, both are allowed.\n* A minimum of 10 patients in the trial (\\~50%) will need to have a PIK3CA mutation in their cancer\n* Patients must have had at least one line of endocrine therapy in the metastatic setting, or be diagnosed with metastatic breast cancer during or within 1 year of adjuvant endocrine therapy. There is no limit on lines of prior treatment in the metastatic setting.\n* Patients must have available tissue (archived formalin-fixed paraffin embedded blocks (FFPB) or fresh frozen tissue from original diagnosis or metastatic setting) for correlative studies. Tissue needs to be located and available at the time of registration (tissue needs to be submitted within 3 weeks of study initiation). Patients will not be able to start study drugs without tissue availability.\n* Life expectancy \u2265 6 months\n* Patients must have adequate hematologic, hepatic, and renal function. All laboratory tests must be obtained less than 1 week from study entry. This includes:\n\n  1. ANC \\>/= 1,500/mm3\n  2. platelet count \\>/=100,000/mm3\n  3. HgB \u2265 9 g/dL\n  4.

Patients must have discontinued the above cancer therapies for 4 weeks prior to the first dose of study medication, as well as recovered from toxicity (to \u2264 than grade 1, except for alopecia) induced by previous treatments. Any investigational drugs should be discontinued 4 weeks prior to the first dose of study medication.\n* Prior hormonal / endocrine therapy \\</= 2 weeks prior to study entry. Patients must have recovered from toxicity \\> grade 1, except for alopecia.\n* Prior therapy with a PI3K inhibitor. Prior use of Akt or mTOR inhibitors are allowed.\n* Patients who have received herbal medications \\</= 2 weeks prior to study entry. Herbal medications include, but are not limited to: St. John's wort, Kava, ephedra (ma huang), gingko biloba, dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), yohimbe, saw palmetto, and ginseng.\n* Use of drugs that are CYP3A4 modifiers\n* Patients who are currently receiving medication with a known risk of prolonging the QT interval or inducing Torsades de Pointes (TdP) and the treatment cannot either be discontinued or switched to a different medication prior to starting study drug treatment.\n* Patients with a family history of congenital long QT syndrome\n* Patients with abnormal calcium, potassium, or magnesium levels that cannot be adequately corrected to within normal range prior to initiation of study drugs\n* Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to:\n\n  1. ongoing or active infection requiring parenteral antibiotics\n  2. impairment of lung function (COPD \\> grade 2, lung conditions requiring oxygen therapy)\n  3. symptomatic congestive heart failure (class III or IV of the New York Heart Association classification for heart disease)\n  4.
