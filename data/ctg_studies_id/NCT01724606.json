Please note: there is no washout period required for trastuzumab and pertuzumab.\n* Prior hormonal therapy for locally advanced or metastatic disease is allowed but this must have been discontinued prior to enrollment. No washout period will be required.\n* Continuation of trastuzumab and pertuzumab are allowed for those patients already on trastuzumab and pertuzumab therapy.\n* Adequate bone marrow, liver, and renal function as assessed by the following:\n* Granulocyte count \u2265 1,000/\u03bcL, platelet count \u2265 100,000/\u03bcL, and hemoglobin \u2265 10 g/dL (hematologic parameters must be assessed at least 14 days after a prior transfusion, if any)\n* Serum bilirubin \u2264 1.5 mg/dL; AST, ALT, and alkaline phosphatase \u2264 2.5 \u00d7 ULN except for: Patients with hepatic metastases: ALT and AST \u2264 5 \u00d7 ULN; patients with hepatic and/or bone metastases:\n* alkaline phosphatase \u2264 5 \u00d7 ULN and patients with Gilbert's disease: serum bilirubin \\< 5 mg/dL\n* Serum creatinine \u2264 1.5 mg/dL or creatinine clearance of \u2265 60 mL/min based on a 24-hour urine collection\n* Women of childbearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test performed within 7 days prior to enrollment and must agree to use adequate contraception prior to enrollment and for the duration of study participation. Subjects (men and women) of childbearing potential must agree to use adequate contraception beginning at the signing of the ICF until at least 30 days after the last dose of study drug.\n* Patients must be able to swallow and retain oral medication.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Leptomeningeal metastases, hemorrhagic metastases, presence of midline shift Please note: leptomeningeal metastases may be allowed if it is limited to cranial metastasis (MRI spine should be completed, within 4 weeks of enrollment, to show that no other leptomeningeal metastases is present) and is not the only metastasis present in the brain.'\n* Contraindications to sorafenib\n* Prior treatment with any agent that targets vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) or VEGF receptors (VEGFR) (licensed or investigational including sorafenib), except bevacizumab.\n* Craniotomy or any other major surgery, open biopsy, or significant traumatic injury within 4 weeks of enrollment.\n* Serious, non-healing wound, ulcer, or bone fracture.\n* Uncontrolled seizures\n* Use of cytochrome P450 enzyme-inducing anti-epileptic drugs (such as phenytoin, carbamazepine, or phenobarbital) is not allowed.\n* Cardiac disease:\n* Congestive heart failure \\>class II New York Heart Association (NYHA) (See Appendix B, or\n* Unstable angina (anginal symptoms at rest), or new-onset angina (begun within the last 3 months), or myocardial infarction within the 6 months prior to enrollment, or\n* Cardiac ventricular arrhythmias requiring anti-arrhythmic therapy.\n* Congenital long QT syndrome or taking drugs known to prolong the QT interval ( See Appendix D or http://www.

However, prophylactic anticoagulation as described below is allowed:\n* Low dose warfarin (1 mg orally, once daily) with PT-INR \u2264 1.5 x ULN is permitted. Infrequent bleeding or elevations in PT-INR have been reported in some subjects taking warfarin while on sorafenib or capecitabine therapy. Therefore, subjects taking concomitant warfarin should be monitored regularly for changes in PT, PT-INR or clinical bleeding episodes.\n* Low dose aspirin (\u2264 100 mg daily).\n* Active clinically serious infection \\>NCI-CTCAE Grade 2.\n* Known human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection or chronic hepatitis B or C (the safety and effectiveness of sorafenib in this patient population have not been studied).\n* Previous or concurrent cancer that is distinct in primary site or histology from breast cancer within 5 years prior to enrollment EXCEPT cervical cancer in situ, treated basal cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), as long as it is other than SCC involving skin of the head and/or neck, and superficial bladder tumors \\[Ta and Tis\\].\n* Subjects who have used strong CYP3A4 inducers (eg, phenytoin, carbamazepine, phenobarbital, St. John's Wort \\[Hypericum perforatum\\], dexamethasone at a dose of greater than 16 mg daily for more than one day, or rifampin \\[rifampicin\\], and/or rifabutin) within 28 days before randomization.\n* Concurrent anti-cancer therapy (chemotherapy, hormonal therapy, radiation therapy (other than that specified by the protocol), surgery, immunotherapy, biologic therapy including trastuzumab, lapatinib, bevacizumab, tyrosine kinase inhibitors other than sorafenib or tumor embolization\n* Women who are pregnant or breast-feeding.\n* Use of any investigational drug within 28 days or 5 half-lives, whichever is longer, preceding enrollment.
