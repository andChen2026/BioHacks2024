Because of possible interference of cytochrome P450 3A4 activity by ixabepilone, patients were excluded from receiving the following medications at enrollment and while enrolled onto the study: amiodarone, clarithromycin, erythromycin, fluconazole, itraconazole, ketoconazole, indinavir, nelfinavir, ritonavir, and saquinavir\n12. Women of childbearing age and potential must be willing to use effective contraception during the study and at least until 90 days after last dose of study drug. Male patients or male patients who have female partners of childbearing age and potential must be willing to use effective contraception during the study and at least until 90 days after last dose of study drug. Highly effective methods of birth control are defined as those which result in a low failure rate (i.e. less than 1% per year) when used consistently and correctly such as intrauterine devices or hormonal contraception (oral contraceptive pills, implants, transdermal patches, vaginal rings or long-acting injections)\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n1. HER2 positive tumor\n2. Concurrent chemotherapy, radiotherapy, hormonal therapy, or other investigational drug except non-disease related conditions (e.g. insulin for diabetes) during study period\n3. Patients with intracranial disease\n4. Other malignancy with exception of curative treated non-melanoma skin cancer or cervical carcinoma in situ within 5 years prior to entering the study\n5. Any active infection requiring parenteral or oral antibiotic treatment.\n6. Patients with grade 2, in case of diabetes grade 1 or greater neuropathy\n7.

Serious cardiac arrhythmia requiring medication\n14. Other medications or conditions, including surgery, that in the Investigator's opinion would contraindicate study participation for safety reasons or interfere with the interpretation of study results.\n15. Requiring immediate palliative treatment of any kind including surgery and/or radiotherapy\n16. Female patients who are pregnant or breast-feeding (pregnancy test with a positive result before study entry)\n17. Known prior severe hypersensitivity reactions to agents containing polyoxyethylated castor oil (Cremophor EL)\n18. Known hypersensitivity to fluoropyrimidines;\n19. Known or suspected dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD) deficiency;\n20. Patients must not continue treatment with the following strong inhibitors of CYP3A4:\n\nketoconazole, itraconazole, ritonavir, amprenavir, indinavir, nelfinavir, delavirdine and voriconazole. These therapies should be discontinued 72 hours prior to initiation of study drug therapy.",
