Any autoimmune, connective tissue or inflammatory disorders (e.g. Rheumatoid arthritis, Sjogren's, sarcoidosis etc.) where there is documented, or a suspicion of pulmonary involvement at the time of screening.

Barrier methods must always be supplemented with the use of a spermicide.\n\n    Female patients must not donate, or retrieve for their own use, ova from the time of enrollment and throughout the study treatment period, and for at least 7 months after the final study drug administration.
