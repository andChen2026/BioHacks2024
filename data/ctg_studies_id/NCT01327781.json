a hormonal regimen containing everolimus is allowed\n    * Either 1 or 2 prior chemotherapy regimens are allowed but not required such that both are in the metastatic setting or one is in the adjuvant setting and one in the metastatic setting (note, an anthracycline and taxane based regimen delivered in the adjuvant setting would be considered one regimen)\n* Willingness to return to Mayo Clinic Rochester, Arizona, or Florida during treatment phase of the trial\n* Dose Escalation cohort only:\n\n  * Mandatory Translational Research Components\n\n    * Willingness to provide biologic specimens (blood and urine)\n  * Dose Escalation cohorts beginning at 160 mg/day: Mandatory Translational Research Components\n\n    * Willingness to provide biologic specimens (tissue)\n  * Dose Expansion cohort(s):\n\n    * Mandatory Translational Research Components\n\n      * Willingness to provide biologic specimens (blood, tissue and urine)\n    * Note: The goals of this study include assessment of the biologic effects on surrogate markers of Z-endoxifen and therefore, are contingent upon availability of the biologic specimens\n* Women of childbearing potential only: negative serum pregnancy test done =\\< 48 hours prior to registration\n* Capable of swallowing 20-mg capsules\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Any of the following therapies prior to registration:\n\n  * Chemotherapy =\\< 3 weeks\n  * Immunotherapy =\\< 3 weeks\n  * Biologic therapy =\\< 3 weeks\n  * Hormonal therapy =\\< 3 weeks\n  * Monoclonal antibodies =\\< 3 weeks\n  * Radiation therapy =\\< 3 weeks\n  * Anti-Her-2 directed therapy =\\< 3 weeks\n* Prior endoxifen therapy\n* Prior history of:\n\n  * Stroke =\\< 6 months prior to registration\n  * Seizures =\\< 3 months prior to registration\n  * Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE) =\\< 12 months prior to registration\n  * Two or more episodes of DVT and/or PE =\\< 5 years prior to registration\n  * Crystalline retinopathy\n  * Abnormal uterine bleeding =\\< 1 year prior to registration\n* Personal history of coagulopathy\n* Active DVT and/or PE requiring anti-coagulant therapy\n\n  * Patients who are on anti-coagulant therapy for maintenance are eligible as long as the DVT and/or PE was \\> 12 months prior to enrollment and there is no evidence for active thrombosis (either DVT or PE)\n* Clinically symptomatic cataracts requiring imminent surgery\n\n  * Note: patients that have cataracts that do not require surgery are eligible\n* Other invasive malignancy that has been diagnosed or has recurred \\< 2 years prior to registration; EXCEPTIONS: non-melanotic skin cancer or carcinoma-in-situ of the cervix\n* Any co-morbid systemic illnesses or other severe concurrent disease which, in the judgment of the investigator, would make the patient inappropriate for entry into this study or interfere significantly with the proper assessment of safety and toxicity of the prescribed regimens\n* Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, hypertension, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements\n* Failure to fully recover from acute, reversible effects of prior chemotherapy regardless of interval since last treatment;
