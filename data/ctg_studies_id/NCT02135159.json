At least 18 years old.\n8. ECOG Performance Status of 0 to 2.\n9. Life expectancy \u2265 3 months.\n10. Potentially reproductive patients must agree to use an effective contraceptive method while on treatment, beginning 2 weeks before the first dose of investigational product and for 28 days after the final dose of investigational product for women. Males able to father a child must practice adequate methods of birth control or practice complete abstinence from intercourse from the first dose of investigational treatment until one week after the final dose of investigational treatment.\n11. Women of childbearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test within 14 days of enrollment and/or urine pregnancy test 48 hours prior to the administration of the first study treatment.\n12. Patients must be affiliated to a Social Security System.\n13. Patient information and written informed consent form signed.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n1. Previous whole brain radiotherapy (WBRT) or brain stereotaxie radiotherapy.\n2. Planned or concurrent systemic treatment or radiation therapy (other than corticosteroid, bisphosphonates or mannitol).\n3. Known contra-indication to MRI.\n4. Active concurrent malignancy. If there is a history of prior malignancy, the patient must be disease free for at least 10 years.\n5. Patients with other concurrent severe and/or uncontrolled medical disease which could compromise participation in the study, such as :\n\n   * infection,\n   * cardiac disease such as uncontrolled hypertension, congestive cardiac failure, ventricular arrhythmias, active ischemic heart disease, myocardial infarction within one year, LVEF \u2264 50%,\n   * current active hepatic or renal disease\n6. Pregnant women, women who are likely to become pregnant or are breast-feeding.\n7. Patients with significantly altered mental status prohibiting the understanding of the study or with psychological, familial, sociological or geographical condition potentially hampering compliance with the study protocol and follow-up schedule; those conditions should be discussed with the patient before registration in the trial.\n8. Known hypersensibility to any component of T-DM1\n9. Patients who received any other investigational drugs within the 30 days prior to the screening visit.\n10. Individual deprived of liberty or placed under the authority of a tutor.\n11. Leptomeningeal metastases diagnosed by MRI\n12. Inclusion in another protocol within 30 days\n13.
