    "studyType": "INTERVENTIONAL",
    "phase": "PHASE1",
    "allocation": "NON_RANDOMIZED",

    "enrollmentCount": 31,
    "primaryOutcomeMeasure": "Define the safety and tolerability of AT13387; establishing the MTD of At13387",
    "eligibilityCriteria": "* INCLUSION CRITERIA:\n* Patients must have histologically documented (confirmed at the Laboratory of Pathology, NCI) solid tumor malignancy that is metastatic or unresectable, for which standard curative measures do not exist, or have failed at least one line of standard therapy.\n* Patients must have measurable or evaluable disease.\n* Patients must have completed any chemotherapy, radiation therapy, or biologic therapy greater than or equal to 4 weeks prior to entering the study (6 weeks for nitrosoureas or mitomycin C).\n\nPatients must be greater than or equal to 2 weeks since any prior administration of a study drug in an exploratory IND/Phase 0 study. Patients must have recovered to eligibility levels from prior toxicity or adverse events. Patients receiving bisphosphonates for any cancer are eligible to participate.\n\n* Age greater than or equal to 18 years. Because no dosing or adverse event data are currently available on the use of AT13387 in patients \\< 18 years of age, children are excluded from this study.\n* The Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status less than or equal to 2.\n* Life expectancy \\> 3 months.\n* Patients must have normal or adequate organ and marrow function as defined below:\n\n  * Absolute neutrophil count greater than or equal to 1,500/microL\n  * Platelets greater than or equal to 100,000/microL\n  * Total bilirubin less than or equal to 1.5 times institutional ULN\n  * AST (SGOT)/ALT (SGPT) less than or equal to 2.5 times institutional ULN\n  * Creatinine \\<1.5 times ULN; OR\n  * Measured creatinine greater than or equal to 60 mL/minute for patients with clearance creatinine levels greater than or equal to 1.5 times ULN\n* The effects of AT13387 on the developing human fetus are unknown. For this reason, women of childbearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control or abstinence) prior to study entry, for the duration of study participation, and for 2 months after completion of study. Women of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test within 72 hours of enrollment in order to be eligible. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately. Because there is an unknown but potential risk to nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with AT13387, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated with AT13387.\n* During the expansion phase of the protocol, patients must have:\n\n  * Disease amenable to biopsy\n  * Willingness to undergo pre- and post-treatment biopsies\n* Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.\n* Currently enrolling in the expansion phase. Patients must have:\n* Disease amenable to biopsy\n* Willingness to undergo pre- and post-treatment biopsies\n\nEXCLUSION CRITERIA:\n\n* Patients with known brain metastases or carcinomatous meningitis are excluded from this clinical trial, with the exception of patients whose brain metastatic disease status has remained stable for greater than or equal to 2 months after treatment of the brain metastases, without steroids or anti-seizure medications. These patients may be enrolled at the discretion of the principal investigator.\n* Patients with clinically significant intercurrent illnesses, including but not limited to, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, uncontrolled cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements.\n* QTc \\> 450 msec for men and \\> 470 msec for women.\n* HIV-positive patients on combination antiretroviral therapy are ineligible because of the potential for PK interactions with AT13387.\n* Pregnant women are ineligible because the effects of AT13387 on the developing human fetus are unknown.\n* Exclude patients with active gastrointestinal bleeding or an event of gastrointestinal bleeding within a week of starting treatment.\n\nINCLUSION OF WOMEN AND MINORITIES:\n\nBoth men and women, and members of all races and ethnic groups, are eligible for this trial.",
