History of extensive interstitial lung disease e.g. pneumonitis or pulmonary fibrosis or any evidence of extensive interstitial lung disease on baseline chest CT scan\n7. Patient with other significant medical or psychiatric condition that would make assessment of toxicity or efficacy difficult.\n8. Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements.\n9.
