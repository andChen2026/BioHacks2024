If enlarged axillary lymph nodes are found during staging scans, FNA must be performed to determine whether the node is involved with cancer.\n   5. If axillary lymph nodes are clinically negative during initial work-up, sentinel node biopsy will be performed prior to initiation of chemotherapy.\n6. ECOG Performance Status of 0 or 1\n7. Adequate organ and hematologic function as evidenced by the following laboratory studies within 4 weeks of study enrollment:\n\n   1. Cardiac Ejection Fraction \\>/= lower limit of normal as determined by 2-D echo or MUGA scan according to institutional standards.\n   2. Hematologic function, as follows: Absolute neutrophil count \u2265 1.5 x 109/L, Platelet count \u2265 100 x 109/L and \u2264 850 x 109/L, Hemoglobin \u2265 9 g/dL, PTT and INR \\< 1.5 x ULN.\n   3. Renal function, as follows: Serum creatinine \\</= 1.4 mg/dL).\n   4. Hepatic function, as follows:Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) \u2264 2.5 x ULN, Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) \u2264 2.5 x ULN , Total bilirubin \u2264 2 x ULN (except for patients with UGT1A1 promoter polymorphism, i.e. Gilbert syndrome, confirmed by genotyping or Invader UGT1A1 molecular assay prior to study enrollment. Patients enrolled with Gilbert syndrome must have total bilirubin \\< 3 ULN).\n8. Patient must be willing and able to undergo MRI as outlined in protocol.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n1. Known hypersensitivity to doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, paclitaxel, cremophor or medications containing cremophor(miconazole, docetaxel, sandimmune, nelfinavir mesylate, propofol, diazepam injection, vitamin K injection, ixabepilone, aci-jel) or carboplatin.\n2. Known HIV or active Hepatitis B or C infection.\n3. Prior treatment for the currently diagnosed breast cancer.\n4. Prior treatment with doxorubicin up to 400 mg/m2.\n5. Pre-existing Grade 3 or 4 sensory neuropathy.\n6. History of bleeding diathesis or extensive bleeding requiring blood transfusion within 14 days of enrollment.\n7. Major surgical procedure within 4 weeks (28 days) prior to enrollment (port placement is not considered a major surgical procedure).\n8. Clinically significant cardiac disease within 12 months of study enrollment, including myocardial infarction, unstable angina, congestive heart failure, or ongoing arrhythmias requiring medication or pacemaker.\n9. Non-healing wound, ulcer or fracture.\n10. Ongoing or active infection.\n11. Pregnant (i.e., positive beta-human chorionic gonadotropin test) or lactating\n12. Not willing to use a highly effective method of birth control (i.e. those which result in low failure rates, less than 1% per year), defined as intrauterine devices, barrier methods (condoms, contraceptive sponges, diaphragms, vaginal rings used with spermicidal jellies or creams), oral contraceptive pills, or sexual abstinence. Contraception must be used during the study.\n13. T0 tumors\n14. Active dental infection",
