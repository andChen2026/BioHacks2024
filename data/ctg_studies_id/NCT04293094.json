Prior exposure to an immune checkpoint inhibitor is allowed.\n* Platinum-Resistant High Grade Serous Ovarian Cancer, primary peritoneal cancer and/or fallopian-tube cancer participants only: Participant must have histologically or cytologically confirmed diagnosis of metastatic or unresectable high grade serous ovarian cancer, with platinum-resistance defined as progression during or within 6 months of a platinum-containing regimen, with no other treatment option available. Prior exposure to platinum-resistant recurrence therapy is allowed.\n* Serous Endometrial Cancer participants only (Dose Exploration only): Participant must have histologically or cytologically confirmed diagnosis of metastatic or recurrent serous endometrial cancer, and be relapsed/refractory to at least one line of systemic therapy in the metastatic/recurrent setting or intolerant of existing therapy(ies) known to provide clinical benefit for their condition.\n* Participants with advanced or metastatic solid tumor with TP53MUT (Dose Exploration only, as assessed by local testing) that is unresectable and relapsed/refractory to at least one line of systemic chemotherapy or intolerant.\n* TNBC participants only (Dose Expansion): Progressed on no more than 3 prior lines of systemic therapy for locally advanced or metastatic disease (not including adjuvant or neo-adjuvant). Systemic therapy with poly ADP ribose polymerase (PARP) inhibitor will be counted as one line of therapy.\n* HGSOC participants only (Dose Expansion): Progressed on no more than 5 prior lines of systemic therapy for locally advanced or metastatic disease (not including adjuvant or neo-adjuvant). Systemic therapy with (PARP) inhibitor will be counted as one line of therapy. Induction followed by maintenance will be counted as one line of therapy.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Untreated or symptomatic brain metastases and leptomeningeal disease (exception: benign asymptomatic tumors are permitted).\n* Current primary CNS tumor, hematological malignancies or lymphoma.\n* Uncontrolled pleural effusions(s), pericardial effusion, or ascites.\n* Gastrointestinal (GI) tract disease causing the inability to take oral medication.",
