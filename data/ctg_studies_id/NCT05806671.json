Most recent tumor biopsy or surgical resection specimen must be either estrogen-receptor (ER) positive, progesterone receptors (PgR) positive, or both, as defined by immunohistochemistry (IHC) \u22651% (as per the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO)-College of American Pathologists (CAP) guidelines).\n3. HER2-low breast cancer defined as IHC 2+/ISH- or IHC 1+ (ISH- or untested). (as per the ASCO-CAP guidelines).\n4.

Patient must have either measurable disease by RECIST 1.1 or only bone lesions in absence of measurable disease.\n6. Eastern Cooperative Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1.\n7. Previously treated on CDK 4/6 inhibitor(palbociclib, abemaciclib or ribociclib) with AI for at least 6 months\n8. Adequate bone marrow and organ function.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n1. Patient with symptomatic visceral disease or any disease burden.\n2. Patient has received more than one line of chemotherapy for advanced disease.\n3. Previous treatment with Dalpiciclib /Pyrotinib /ADCe for advanced disease.\n4. Progressed on more than one CDK 4/6 inhibitor\n5. Patients with persistent symptoms and unstable brain metastases;\n6.
