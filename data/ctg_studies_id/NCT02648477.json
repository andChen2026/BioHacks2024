post-menopausal is defined by at least one of the following criteria:\n\n  * Prior bilateral oophorectomy OR amenorrheic for \\>= 12 months (if =\\< 55 years of age and prior chemotherapy or on medical ovarian ablative therapy or received ovarian radiation for ablation in the past 5 years and/or tamoxifen or an aromatase inhibitor (AI) within the past year, then follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and estradiol must be in the post-menopausal range and obtained within 28 days prior to registration) OR\n  * Previous hysterectomy with one or both ovaries left in place (or previous hysterectomy in which documentation of bilateral oophorectomy is unavailable AND FSH values consistent with the institutional normal values for the post-menopausal state; FSH levels must be obtained within 28 days prior to registration\n* Female subject of childbearing potential should have a negative urine or serum pregnancy within 72 hours prior to receiving the first dose of study medication; if the urine test is positive or cannot be confirmed as negative, a serum pregnancy test will be required\n* Female subjects of childbearing potential should be willing to use 2 methods of birth control or be surgically sterile, or abstain from heterosexual activity for the course of the study through 120 days after the last dose of study medication;
