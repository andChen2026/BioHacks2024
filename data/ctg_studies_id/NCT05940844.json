Patients with accessible metastatic lesions for repetitive biopsy retrieval.\n4. Patients with histologically or cytologically confirmed metastatic colorectal, pancreatic, gastric, breast, or urothelial tumors who have progressed or were intolerant after two or more regimens and for whom no standard of care or curative therapy options are available.\n5. Patients with an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status (PS) of 0 or 1 within 7 days of the start of treatment\n6. Patients with evaluable and measurable lesions as per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1\n7. Patients with adequate organ function at the time of enrollment as defined below:\n\n   1. Neutrophil count \u22651500/mm3\n   2. Platelet count \u22657.5 \u00d7 105/mm3\n   3.

In women with the potential for pregnancy (including patients with amenorrhea due to medical reasons, such as chemical menopause), after consenting to the study, the patient must agree to use contraception from enrollment and for at least 12 weeks after taking the final dose of the investigational drug.

Menopause is defined as the consecutive absence of menstrual periods for \u226512 months. Total abstinence is an acceptable mode of contraception.\n9. In the case of men, the patient must agree after consenting to the study to use contraception from enrollment and for at least 13 weeks after taking the final dose of the investigational drug (a period of 90 days \\[the spermatogenesis cycle\\] is added to 5-times the elimination half-time of I/O agent. Total abstinence is an acceptable mode of contraception.\n\nExclusion criteria:\n\n1. Unwilling to undergo biopsy retrieval during screening (unless an archival sample taken within 3 months before screening is available) and after the fourth infusion of OB-002\n2. Patients who have undergone systemic chemotherapy, radiotherapy, surgery, or hormone therapy \\<28 days before enrollment, also see exclusion criterion #8.\n\n   Note: Patients must have recovered from all AEs due to previous therapies to \u2264Grade 1 or baseline. Patients with \u2264Grade 2 neuropathy may be eligible. If patients received major surgery, they must have recovered adequately from the toxicity and/or complications from the intervention prior to starting study treatment.\n3. Patients with a history of CCR5 antagonist therapy (e.g., vicriviroc, maraviroc).\n4.

Patients with acute coronary syndrome (including myocardial infarction and unstable angina), and with a history of coronary angioplasty or stent placement performed within 6 months before enrollment\n7. Patients with a large amount of pleural effusion or ascites requiring more than weekly drainage\n8.

Patients with partial or complete gastrointestinal obstruction\n12. Patients with interstitial lung disease requiring treatment with systemic steroids or other agents\n13. Patients who test positive for either anti-human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) antibodies, hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), or anti-hepatitis C virus (HCV) antibodies with a positive HCV RNA viral load test\n14. Patients with concurrent autoimmune disease, or a history of chronic or recurrent autoimmune disease\n15.
