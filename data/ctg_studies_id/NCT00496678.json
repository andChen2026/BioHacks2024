Have received a positive breast or colorectal cancer screening test requiring follow-up on a different day\n3. Have been newly diagnosed with breast or colorectal cancer\n4.

Institutionalized (nursing home, incarcerated)\n3. Children \\<18\n4. Actively involved in cancer treatment at time of presentation\n5. Currently or previously navigated with (a) navigation documented in the medical record or (b) patient can articulate that they are in a navigation program or case management program for cancer\n6. History of prior invasive cancer, lymphoma, or leukemia except non-melanoma (basal or squamous of the skin) cancer or CIN (Cervical intraepithelial neoplasia).\n7. Prior cancer that has been treated-The rationale for excluding patients with any prior cancers that have been treated is that patient familiarity with the treatment process in general would make care easier even without a navigator.\n8.
