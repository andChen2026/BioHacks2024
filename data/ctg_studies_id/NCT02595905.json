documentation of germline test results are required\n* Patients must have measurable or non-measurable disease; patients must have a chest/abdominal/pelvis computed tomography (CT) scan (or positron emission tomography \\[PET\\]/CT of diagnostic quality, conventional or spiral) prior to registration;

note that endocrine and immunotherapies do not count as cytotoxic regimens\n* Patients must have completed any prior radiation therapy and hormonal therapy at least 14 days prior to registration\n* Patients may receive bisphosphonates or denosumab concurrently with study treatment; if started prior to registration, it must be started at least 7 days prior to registration\n* Patients must have recovered to =\\< grade 2 following a significant adverse event or toxicity attributed to previous anti-cancer treatment except neurotoxicity which must be =\\< grade 1\n* Patients must have a performance status of 0-2 by Zubrod criteria\n* Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) of \\>= 1,500/mL (within 21 days prior to registration);

patients must not have had a blood transfusion within 28 days prior to registration\n* Bilirubin =\\< 1.5 mg/dL (or =\\< 3.0 mg/dL if due to Gilbert's syndrome or if liver metastases are present) (within 21 days prior to registration)\n* Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) =\\< 2.5 x institutional upper limit of normal (IULN) (or =\\< 5 x IULN if liver metastases are present) (within 21 days prior to registration)\n* Patients must have adequate renal function with serum creatinine level =\\< IULN within 21 days prior to registration\n* Patients must have serum chemistries (including potassium and magnesium) within 21 days prior to registration to obtain baseline values\n* Patients must be able to swallow whole capsules\n* Patients with a history of uncontrolled seizure disorder; including focal or generalized seizure may not have had a seizure within one year prior to registration\n* Patients with known brain metastases must either meet the additional criteria and enroll as part of the Progressive Brain Metastases Cohort, or have clinically controlled neurologic symptoms, defined as surgical excision and/or radiation therapy followed by 14 days of stable neurologic function prior to registration; patients with previously incidentally discovered or asymptomatic brain metastasis(es) must receive surgical excision and/or radiation therapy prior to registration; patients with progressive brain metastases following prior treatment are not eligible for the Standard Cohort, but may be considered for the Progressive Brain Metastases Cohort\n* Patients must have a complete history and physical examination within 28 days prior to registration\n* Patients of childbearing potential must not be pregnant (negative pregnancy test) or nursing due to the possibility of harm to a fetus or nursing infant from this treatment regimen; men and women of reproductive potential must have agreed to use an effective contraceptive method for 6 months after completion of study treatment; a woman is considered to be of \"reproductive potential\" if she has had menses at any time in the preceding 12 consecutive months; in addition to routine contraceptive methods, \"effective contraception\" also includes heterosexual celibacy and surgery intended to prevent pregnancy (or with a side-effect of pregnancy prevention) defined as a hysterectomy, bilateral oophorectomy or bilateral tubal ligation; however, if at any point a previously celibate patient chooses to become heterosexually active during the time period for use of contraceptive measures outlined in the protocol, he/she is responsible for beginning contraceptive measures\n* No other prior malignancy is allowed except for the following: adequately treated basal cell or squamous cell skin cancer, in situ cervical cancer, adequately treated stage I or II cancer from which the patient is currently in complete remission, or any other cancer from which the patient has been disease free for five years\n* Patients must be informed of the investigational nature of this study and must sign and give written informed consent in accordance with institutional and federal guidelines\n* As part of the Oncology Patient Enrollment Network (OPEN) registration process the treating institution's identity is provided in order to ensure that the current (within 365 days) date of institutional review board approval for this study had been entered in the system\n* Progressive Brain Metastases Cohort\n\n  * S1416 is one study with two cohorts; patients who have progressive brain metastases after surgical excision and/or intracranial radiation will be in the Progressive Brain Metastases Cohort and will require a baseline magnetic resonance imaging (MRI); patients with previously treated brain metastases, stable disease and stable neurologic function for 14 days prior to trial registration will be in the Standard Cohort and may obtain MRI of the brain at the physician's discretion; randomization and treatment is the same for both cohorts\n  * In addition to all of the previous eligibility criteria, patients with progressive brain metastases who do not satisfy the conditions to enroll in the standard cohort (neurologic stability for 14 days following surgery and/or radiation therapy) must also meet the following criteria to enroll as part of the brain metastases cohort:\n\n    * Patients with progressive brain metastases must have a baseline brain MRI within 28 days prior to registration; brain metastases must be progressive and \\>= 10 mm in longest dimension on radiographic imaging AFTER prior intracranial radiation (IR) therapy (i.e., whole brain radiation therapy \\[WBRT\\], stereotactic radiosurgery \\[SRS\\], gamma knife \\[GK\\] or local equivalent); patients must not have evidence of diffuse leptomeningeal disease on brain MRI or by previously documented cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) cytology; discrete dural metastases are permitted; there must be no evidence of hemorrhage or impending herniation on baseline brain imaging; patients with contraindication to gadolinium-enhanced MRI imaging are not eligible\n    * Patients must be on a stable or decreasing dose of steroids for \\>= 7 days prior to registration\n    * If patient had an open brain biopsy, at least 28 days must have elapsed between biopsy and registration\n    * Patients enrolling in the Progressive Brain Metastases Cohort can have received up to 3 prior lines of cytotoxic chemotherapy for metastatic disease; note that for enrollment in the standard cohort, patients must have had =\\< 1 prior cytotoxic regimen for metastatic disease\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Patients must not have received prior cisplatin or poly (adenosine diphosphate \\[ADP\\]-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors; prior carboplatin in the adjuvant/neoadjuvant setting is allowed, if completed more than 12 months prior to study entry\n* Patients must not have received any chemotherapy within 14 days prior to registration\n* Patients must not have received any immunotherapy, biologic or any investigational drug within 28 days prior to registration; patients must not have received bevacizumab within 42 days prior to registration\n* Patients must not have a clinically relevant hearing impairment \\>= grade 2\n* Patients must not have treatment-related acute myeloid leukemia (AML) (t-AML)/myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) or features suggestive of AML/MDS\n* Patients must not have had prior allogeneic bone marrow transplant or double umbilical cord blood transplantation\n* Patients must not have any incidence of or uncontrolled medical illness (e.g. active cardiac symptoms, active systemic infection, etc.) that would limit the patient's ability to participate in the protocol\n* Patients must not have baseline peripheral neuropathy that exceeds grade 1",
