Hormone receptor-negative (ER and PgR \\< 10%) and HER2-negative (IHC 0,1+ or 2+ ISH not amplified) breast cancer, based on the status of the primary tumor and/or the biopsy of metastatic disease before starting first-line therapy and assessed by local laboratory.\n5. Patients ER and PgR \\< 1% eligible to receive atezolizumab in combination with nab-paclitaxel as standard of care treatment for metastatic triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), regardless of study participation.\n6. PD-L1 positive defined as expression on tumor-infiltrating immune cells \u22651% (SP142 PD-L1 immunohistochemical assay, Ventana Medical Systems), based on the status of the primary tumor and/or the biopsy of metastatic disease before starting first-line therapy and assessed by local laboratory\n7. Availability of a representative tumor specimen for translational research\n8. Eligible for first-line taxane and carboplatin chemotherapy\n9. No prior chemotherapy or targeted systemic therapy (including endocrine therapy) for inoperable locally advanced or metastatic TNBC. Prior radiation therapy for metastatic disease is permitted. There is no required minimum washout period for radiation therapy; however, patients should have recovered from the effects of radiation before enrollment\n10. Previous chemotherapy with taxanes and/or carboplatin for early breast cancer (neoadjuvant or adjuvant setting) is permitted if completed \u226512 months before study entry\n11. Previous therapy with immune checkpoint inhibitors for early breast cancer (neoadjuvant or adjuvant setting) is permitted if completed \u226512 months before study entry\n12. ECOG performance status of 0 or 1\n13. Life expectancy \u2265 12 weeks\n14. Measurable or evaluable disease as defined by RECIST v1.1.\n15. Adequate hematologic and end-organ function, defined by laboratory results obtained within 2 weeks prior to the first study treatment (Cycle 1, Day 1)\n16. Negative human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) test at screening\n17. Negative hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) test at screening\n18. Negative total hepatitis B core antibody (HBcAb) test at screening, or positive HBcAb test followed by a negative hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA test at screening. The HBV DNA test will be performed only for patients who have a positive HBcAb test\n19. Negative hepatitis C virus (HCV) antibody test at screening, or positive HCV antibody test followed by a negative HCV RNA test at screening. The HCV RNA test will be performed only for patients who have a positive HCV antibody test\n20. Women of child bearing potential must agree to either use a contraceptive method with a failure rate of \u2264 1% per year or to remain abstinent (refrain from heterosexual intercourse) during the treatment period and for at least 5 months after the last dose of atezolizumab, or for at least 6 months after the last dose of paclitaxel. A woman is considered to be of childbearing potential if she is postmenarcheal, has not reached a postmenopausal state (\u2265 12 continuous months of amenorrhea with no identified cause other than menopause), and has not undergone surgical sterilization (removal of ovaries and/or uterus). Examples of contraceptive methods with a failure rate of \u2264 1% per year include bilateral tubal ligation, male sterilization, hormonal contraceptives that inhibit ovulation, hormone-releasing intrauterine devices, and copper intrauterine devices. The reliability of sexual abstinence should be evaluated in relation to the duration of the clinical trial and the preferred and usual lifestyle of the patient. Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, or post-ovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception\n21. Women of child bearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test result within 7 days prior to initiation of study drug\n22. For men: agreement to remain abstinent (refrain from heterosexual intercourse) or use contraceptive measures and agreement to refrain from donating sperm\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n1.

Patients should be recovered from the effects of radiation. There is no required minimum recovery period.\n   3. Asymptomatic metastatic lesions whose further growth would likely cause functional deficits or intractable pain (e.g., epidural metastasis that is not presently associated with spinal cord compression) should be considered for loco-regional therapy if appropriate prior to enrollment.\n5.
