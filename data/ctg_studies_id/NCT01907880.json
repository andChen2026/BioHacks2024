High-risk of subsequent SRE as reflected through either: elevated serum CTX (\\> 400ng/L) and/or bone pain (using BPI) and/or prior SRE while on bisphosphonate therapy and/or progressive bone metastasis (by imaging)\n3. On pamidronate therapy for at least 3 months\n4. ECOG \u2264 2 and life expectancy \\> 3 months\n5. Serum creatinine \u2264 2.0 \u00d7 ULN (zoledronic acid or pamidronate to be renal dosed as per institution standard)\n6. No changes in systemic treatment in the 4 weeks prior to study entry or anticipated changes in the 4 weeks after entering the study. Markers of bone formation can be affected by a change in systemic therapies\n7. Ability to take calcium and Vitamin D as per Health Canada recommended daily doses for the duration of the study\n8. Ability to provide informed consent and complete study evaluations.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n1. Patients with acute symptomatic pathological fractures or acute spinal cord compression until such time as the appropriate management (surgery and/or radiotherapy) has been completed\n2. Acute hypercalcemia (\\>3.5 mmol/L)\n3. Hypersensitivity to any bisphosphonate\n4. Patients with rapidly progressive non-bone metastases for whom delaying a change in systemic anti-cancer treatment for the 1 month biochemical marker evaluation period could have a detrimental impact on patient outcome.\n5. Renal dysfunction (\u2265 2x creatinine of the upper limit of normal )\n6. Pregnancy or lactation\n7. Patients with dental abscesses or patients potentially requiring tooth extraction while on study",
