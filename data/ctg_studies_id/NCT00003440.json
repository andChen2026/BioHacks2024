    "eligibilityCriteria": "Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Histologically confirmed adenocarcinoma of the female breast which is inoperable, recurrent or metastatic\n* HER-2/neu status must be known at the time of protocol registration; HER-2/neu assessment will be based on FISH analysis of either the primary tumor or a metastatic site; a scoring of 0 or 1+ by immunohistochemistry (IHC) is considered negative; 2+ is considered negative unless confirmed by FISH positivity, in which case it should be considered positive; 3+ by IHC is considered positive; for centers using FISH only, a positive FISH assay by itself is sufficient to determine HER-2 positivity\n* Patients with the following prior therapy are eligible:\n\n  * Patients with 0-1 prior chemotherapy regimens for metastatic or locally advanced breast cancer, with the following exception: no prior taxane for metastatic/locally advanced breast cancer\n  * Patients with 0-1 prior chemotherapy regimens in the adjuvant setting; if adjuvant regimen included a taxane, patient must have been disease free for at least 12 months from completion of adjuvant therapy until relapse\n  * Patients must be \\> 2 weeks from prior surgery, other than simple biopsy or placement of venous access device; patients must be \\> 4 weeks from prior chemotherapy; patients must be \\>6 weeks from nitrosoureas, melphalan, or mitomycin\n\n    * Patients must be \\> 4 weeks from prior hormonal therapy unless tumor measurements document clear progression while on treatment; if progression is documented and toxicity from hormonal regimen has resolved, patients may be placed on study \\> 1 week from prior hormonal therapy\n* Prior Herceptin therapy is not allowed\n* Patients with central nervous system metastases are eligible only if the patient has completed cranial irradiation at least 6 months prior, is currently asymptomatic, and is not currently receiving corticosteroids for this condition; patients with leptomeningeal carcinoma (carcinomatous meningitis) are not eligible\n* MESURABLE DISEASE: Any mass reproducibly measurable in two perpendicular dimensions, examples include:\n\n  * Pulmonary nodules\n  * Hepatic lesions\n  * Skin nodules (if two measurements can be assigned)\n  * Lymph nodes\n* The following lesions do not qualify as measurable:\n\n  * Central nervous system (CNS) lesions\n  * Bone disease only; lytic lesions should be documented and followed\n  * Lymphangitic pulmonary metastases (patients with lymphangitic metastases are eligible if there are other sites of metastatic disease which can be measured)\n  * Lesions which have been irradiated unless there is definite documentation of progression since radiotherapy\n* A baseline assessment of left ventricular ejection fraction within 8 weeks of registration is required (echocardiogram or resting multi gated acquisition scan \\[MUGA\\] (radionuclide cineangiography \\[RNCA\\]) nuclear scintigraphy); patients with a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) \\< 45% are ineligible\n* Granulocytes \\>= 1500/ul\n* Platelet count \\>= 100,000/ul\n* Creatinine =\\< 2.0 mg/dl\n* Bilirubin within institutional normal limits\n* Serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase (SGOT) (aspartate aminotransferase \\[AST\\])",
