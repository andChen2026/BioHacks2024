Patients diagnosed with a non-metastatic TNBC (ER \\& PR \\<10%, HER2- per ASCO/CAP guidelines).

For patients receiving an experimental adjuvant treatment in a clinical trial, any intervention planned as part of this trial must be completed before inclusion.\n5. High-risk primary tumor, defined as:\n\n   1. Lack of pathological complete response after neoadjuvant chemotherapy (RCB I, II or III; RCB I being capped to a maximum of 30% of included patients) OR, in the absence of neoadjuvant chemotherapy,\n   2. Stage IIB-III (i.e., T2N1, any T3-T4, any N2-3) OR\n   3. Any loco-regional relapse occurring after a prior ipsilateral, curatively treated TNBC\n6. No sign of local or distant relapse, as per investigator assessment\n7. Performance status \\< 2\n8. Available FFPE tumor block with \\> 10% cellularity or 11 tumor sections with \\>10% cellularity\n9. Patient able to comply with protocol requirements\n10. Patients covered by a health insurance\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n1. Any uncontrolled disease, metabolic dysfunction, physical examination finding, or clinical laboratory finding or any other medical condition that, in the opinion of the investigator, interferes with the trial procedures\n2.

Any stage I-II malignancy treated with curative intent with no evidence of active disease in the last five years\n7. For step #2 (randomization after ctDNA detection): clinical/radiological metastatic relapse before the detection of the molecular relapse.",
