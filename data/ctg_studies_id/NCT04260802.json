Must have failed a previous IO agent.\n   * Merkel Cell: Must have failed at least 1 prior systemic therapy for advanced disease and may have failed a previous IO agent.\n   * Squamous Cell Carcinoma of the Skin: Must have failed at least 1 prior systemic therapy for advanced disease and may have failed a previous IO agent.\n\n     3. Phase 1b - combination dose escalation:\n   * Cervical Cancer Must have failed at least 1 chemotherapy regimen.\n   * Bladder Cancer Must have failed a platinum-containing chemotherapy regimen. Must have failed a previous immune checkpoint inhibitor.\n   * RCC Must have failed at least 1 prior systemic therapy. Must have failed a previous IO agent.\n   * Urothelial cancer Must have failed at least 1 prior systemic therapy. Must have failed a previous IO agent.\n   * Diffuse large B cell lymphoma Must have failed prior rituximab therapy. May have failed prior chemotherapy or other IO agents.\n   * NSCLC Must have failed a single agent PD-1 or PD-L1 inhibitor as the last regimen and must have responded to the agent.\n   * Must not have any history of tumors that test positive for EGFR, ROS1, ALK mutations or ALK fusions, or any other mutations for which tyrosine kinase inhibitors are available or are under development.\n\n     4.
