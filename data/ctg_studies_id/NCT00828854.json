Creatinine less than 2.5 times the upper limit of normal for the institution.\n   3. aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) less than 2.5 times the upper limit of normal for the institution.\n7. Able to understand and give written informed consent and comply with study procedures.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n1. Discontinuation of AI therapy prior to study entry.\n2. Less than 3 months treatment with most recent AI.\n3. Rapidly progressive, life-threatening metastases, including any of the following:\n\n   1. Symptomatic lymphangitic metastases.\n   2. Patients with known active brain or leptomeningeal involvement.\n4. More than one prior chemotherapy for metastatic disease.\n5. Any chemotherapy within 3 months prior to study.\n6. Radiotherapy to measurable lesion within 2 months prior to study.\n7. Bisphosphonates initiated within 4 weeks prior to study start.\n8. Allergy to benzamides or inactive components of study drug.\n9. Previous treatment with entinostat or any other histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor including valproic acid.\n10. Patient is currently receiving treatment with any agent listed on the prohibited medication list such as valproic acid or other systemic cancer agents\n11. Any concomitant medical condition that precludes adequate study treatment compliance or assessment, or increases patient risk in the opinion of the investigator:\n\n    1. Myocardial infarction or arterial thromboembolic events within 6 months, or experiencing severe or unstable angina, New York Heart Association (NYHA) Class III or IV disease and a QTc interval \\>0.47 second.\n    2.
