Because no dosing or adverse event data are currently available on the use of cediranib or olaparib in participants \\< 18 years of age, children are excluded from this study but will be eligible for future pediatric trials\n* Estimated life expectancy of greater than 6 months\n* Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 0 or 1 (Karnofsky \\> 60%)\n* Absolute neutrophil count \\>= 1,500/mcL\n* Platelets \\>= 100,000/mcL\n* Hemoglobin \\> 9 g/dL\n\n  * For patients enrolled to the Phase 1-T portion of the protocol, the hemoglobin should be \\>= 10 g/dL\n* Total bilirubin within 1.5 times the upper limit of normal institutional limits\n* Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase \\[SGOT\\])/alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (serum glutamate pyruvate transaminase \\[SGPT\\]) =\\< 2.5 x institutional upper limit of normal\n* Creatinine =\\< the institutional upper limit of normal or creatinine clearance \\>= 60 mL/min/1.73 m\\^2 for subjects with creatinine levels above institutional normal\n* Less than or equal to 1+ proteinuria on two consecutive dipsticks taken no less than 1 week apart, or \\< 1 gm protein on 24-hour urine collection or a urine protein: creatinine ratio of \\< 1\n* Troponin T or I within normal institutional limits\n* Coagulation parameters (international normalized ratio \\[INR\\], activated partial thromboplastin time \\[aPTT\\]) within 1.25 x upper limit of normal institutional limits, except where a Lupus anti-coagulant has been confirmed\n* Toxicities of prior therapy (except alopecia) should be resolved to less than or equal to grade 1 as per National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 4.0 (NCI-CTCAE v4.0); patients with long-standing stable grade 2 neuropathy may be considered after discussion with the overall principal investigator (PI)\n* Subjects with treated limited stage basal cell or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin or carcinoma in situ of the breast or cervix are eligible; subjects with prior cancer treated with a curative intent with no evidence of recurrent disease 5 years following diagnosis and judged by the investigator to be at low risk of recurrence are eligible; subjects with any other concomitant or prior invasive malignancies are ineligible\n* Patients who have the following risk factors are considered to be at increased risk for cardiac toxicities; these patients should have increased monitoring:\n\n  * Prior treatment with anthracyclines\n  * Prior treatment with trastuzumab\n  * A New York Heart Association classification of II controlled with treatment\n  * Prior central thoracic radiation therapy (RT), including RT to the heart\n  * History of myocardial infarction within 12 months (patients with history of myocardial infarction within 6 months are excluded from the study)\n* The effects of cediranib and olaparib on the developing human fetus are unknown; for this reason, women of child-bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry, for the duration of study participation, and for 3 months following treatment discontinuation; should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately\n* Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent\n* Patients must be able to tolerate oral medications and not have gastrointestinal illnesses that would preclude absorption of cediranib or olaparib\n* Patients must be willing and able to check and record daily blood pressure readings\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Participants who have had chemotherapy or radiotherapy within 3 weeks (6 weeks for nitrosoureas or mitomycin C) prior to entering the study or those who have not recovered from adverse events due to agents administered more than 3 weeks earlier\n* Participants may not be receiving any other investigational agents nor have participated in an investigational trial within the past 4 weeks; subjects may not have received prior treatment affecting the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) pathway in the recurrent setting, including thalidomide, bevacizumab, sunitinib, or sorafenib; in the Phase I portion of the trial, subjects may not have received prior treatment with oregovomab (OvaRex) or any other antibodies that may interfere with CA-125 measurements\n* Patients with untreated brain metastases, spinal cord compression, or evidence of symptomatic brain metastases or leptomeningeal disease as noted on computed tomography (CT) or MRI scans should not be included on this study, since neurologic dysfunction may confound the evaluation of neurologic and other adverse events; screening imaging to rule out brain metastases is not required for screening, but should be performed prior to study enrollment if clinically indicated; patients with treated brain metastases and resolution of any associated symptoms must demonstrate stable post-therapeutic imaging for at least 6 months following therapy prior to starting study drug\n* History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic composition to cediranib maleate or olaparib\n* Participants receiving any medications or substances that are strong inhibitors or inducers of cytochrome P450, family 3, subfamily A, polypeptide 4 (CYP3A4) are ineligible;

patients with hypertension may be managed with up to a maximum of three antihypertensive medications; patients who are on three antihypertensive medications must be actively followed by a cardiologist or blood pressure specialist for management of blood pressure while on protocol\n* Any prior history of hypertensive crisis or hypertensive encephalopathy\n* Clinical significant peripheral vascular disease or vascular disease (aortic aneurysm or aortic dissection)\n* Unstable angina\n* Major surgical procedure, open biopsy, or significant traumatic injury within 28 days prior to starting cediranib\n* History of abdominal fistula, gastrointestinal perforation or intra-abdominal abscess\n* Current signs and/or symptoms of bowel obstruction or signs and/or symptoms of bowel obstruction within 3 months prior to starting study drugs\n* Current dependency on intravenous (IV) hydration or total parenteral nutrition (TPN)\n* Evidence of coagulopathy or bleeding diathesis; therapeutic anticoagulation for prior thromboembolic events is permitted\n* Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to ongoing or active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements\n* Pregnant women are excluded from this study because cediranib and olaparib are agents with the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects; because there is an unknown but potential risk of adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with cediranib and olaparib, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated with cediranib or olaparib; these potential risks may also apply to other agents used in this study\n* Known human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive individuals are ineligible because of the potential for pharmacokinetic interactions with cediranib or olaparib; in addition, these individuals are at increased risk of lethal infections when treated with marrow-suppressive therapy\n* Patients may not use natural herbal products or other \"folk remedies\" while participating in this study\n* No features suggestive of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) or acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) on peripheral blood smear or bone marrow biopsy, if clinically indicated",
