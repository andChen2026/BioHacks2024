Complete resection of the primary tumor with margins of resection free of invasive carcinoma not more than 6 weeks ago\n5. Females \u2265 18 years of age\n6. Performance status \u2264 2 on ECOG-Scale\n7. Adequate bone marrow reserve: leucocytes \u2265 3.0 x 109/l and platelets \u2265 100 x 109/l\n8. Bilirubin within the reference laboratory's normal range, ASAT (SGOT), ALAT (SGPT) and AP within 1,5 fold of the reference laboratory's normal range for patients\n9. Willingness to participate in a telephone-based lifestyle intervention programme \\[10.\\] Intention of regular follow up visits for the duration of the study \\[11.\\] Ability to understand the nature of the study and to give written informed consent\n\nPatients will be excluded from the study for any of the following reasons:\n\n1. Inflammatory breast cancer\n2. Previous or concomitant cytotoxic or other systemic antineoplastic treatment which is not part of this study\n3. A second primary malignancy (except in situ carcinoma of the cervix or adequately treated basal cell carcinoma of the skin)\n4. Cardiomyopathy with impaired ventricular function (NYHA \\> II), cardiac arrhythmias influencing LVEF and requiring medication, history of myocardial infarction or angina pectoris within the last 6 months, or arterial hypertension not being controlled by medication\n5. Any known hypersensitivity against Docetaxel, Epirubicine, Cyclophosphamide, or any other medication included in the study protocol. The contraindication, warning notices and measures of precaution of the products, as notified in the product infroamtion, have to be respected\n6. Use of any investigational agent within 3 weeks prior to inclusion\n7. Patients in pregnancy or breast feeding (in premenopausal women anticonception has to be assured)\n8. Insulin-requiring diabetes mellitus (non-insulin requiring patients with type 2 diabetes are eligible for the study)\n9. Serious digestive and/or absorptive problems that exclude adherence to the study diet \\[10.\\] Self-reported inability to walk at least one kilometer (at any pace) \\[11.\\] Cardiovascular, respiratory or musculoskeletal disease or joint problems that preclude moderate physical activity. Moderate arthritis that does not preclude physical activity is not a reason for exclusion \\[12.\\] Psychiatric disorders or conditions that would preclude participation in the study intervention \\[13.\\] Patients not sufficiently fluent in German language to understand the nature of this study and any of the interventional measures",
