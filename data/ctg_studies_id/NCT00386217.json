    "eligibilityCriteria": "Inclusion Criteria:\n\n1. Women must be survivors of breast cancer, cervical cancer, Hodgkin's Disease, or non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. (We have chosen these three sites because they are the most common malignancies in women of reproductive age that have reasonable rates of long-term survival. In addition, many of the standard treatments for these malignancies impair fertility.)\n2. Women must have been diagnosed before the age of 41, i.e., of childbearing age at the time of diagnosis and/or beyond.\n3. Women must be at least age 14 currently to participate, because of the concern that younger girls may not be emotionally mature enough to have considered the emotional aspects of infertility, and may also not have full knowledge about reproduction.\n4. Women must must have been diagnosed between the years of 1993-1998, making them, roughly 5- to 10-year survivors.\n5. We are not going to exclude women based on cancer stage or treatment status, as long as they have survived for 5 to 10 years.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n1. Women's fluency in English must be adequate to complete the interview (approximately 6th grade level).",
