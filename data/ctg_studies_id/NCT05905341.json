Participants with a history of CNS metastases or cord compression are eligible if they have been definitively treated (eg, radiotherapy, stereotactic surgery) and are clinically stable off anticonvulsants and steroids for at least 4 weeks before enrollment and have no evidence of progression at time of study enrollment.\n* Participants with advanced/metastatic, symptomatic, visceral spread, that are at risk of life-threatening complications in the short term (eg, including participants with massive uncontrolled effusions \\[pleural, pericardial, peritoneal\\], pulmonary lymphangitis, and over 50% liver involvement).\n* Any other active malignancy within 3 years prior to enrollment, except for adequately treated basal cell or squamous cell skin cancer, or carcinoma in situ.\n* Last anticancer treatment within 2 weeks (or 5 half-lives, whichever is shorter), unless the last immediate anticancer treatment contained an antibody-based agent(s) (approved or investigational), then the interval of 4 weeks or 5 half-lives (whichever is shorter) is required prior to receiving the study intervention.",
