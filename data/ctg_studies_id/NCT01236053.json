Follow-up ends Dec 31, 2008, or earlier if the subject leaves the GPRD for any reason including death.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Subjects are excluded from the GPRD cohort if they have a cancer diagnosis or a history of cancer prior to the cohort entry date. Cases and controls will be required to have at least 2 years of follow-up in the study cohort before their index date (For cases, the index date is the date of first diagnosis of the respective cancer. The index date for controls is set as the date at which the follow-up time from cohort entry is the same as the case.)
