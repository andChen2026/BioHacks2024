Measureable disease is not required\n5. Patient must have adequate organ function\n6. Female patient of childbearing potential must have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test quantitative human chorionic gonadotropin (\u03b2-hCG) within 72 hours prior to receiving the first dose of study medication and agree to the use of effective methods of contraception while on study.\n7. Any number of prior lines of chemotherapy in the metastatic setting is allowed.\n8. Concomitant use of bisphosphonates is allowed.\n9. Patients with stable and clinically insignificant CNS disease are allowed. Patients must be off steroids with no new CNS symptoms or findings on radiographic imaging for 1 month.\n10. Patients willing and able to complete the questionnaires.\n11. Patients willing and able to comply with the study protocol for the duration of the study.\n12.
