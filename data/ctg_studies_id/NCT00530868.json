Patients with inflammatory breast cancer will not be included (T4d). Patients previously treated patients with no measurable disease or patients with metastatic disease will be excluded.\n* Give written informed consent prior to study specific screening procedures, with the understanding that the patient has the right to withdraw from the study at any time, without prejudice.\n* Patients must be postmenopausal, defined as one of the following:\n\n  * Patients \\> 50 years of age with no spontaneous menses for at least 12 months,\n  * Bilateral oophorectomy\n* Be ambulatory (outpatient) and have an ECOG PS \\<1.\n* Patients must have measurable disease by mammogram and/or breast ultrasound (in special cases a dedicated breast MRI may be clinically indicated). The target lesion must not have been previously irradiated.\n* No prior chemotherapy.\n* Patients must have adequate organ and marrow function as defined as follows: absolute neutrophil count \\> 1,500/mm3, hemoglobin \\> 8.0 g/dl, platelets \\> 75,000/mm3, total bilirubin \\< 2 mg/dl, serum creatinine \\< 2 mg/dl, Transaminases (AST, ALT) may be up to 2 x institutional upper limit of normal. In addition \\< 1 gr of protein in 24 hr urine collection and urine protein/creatinine ratio \\< 1.0.\n* No life threatening parenchymal disease or rapidly progressing disease warranting cytotoxic chemotherapy.\n* Hypertension must be controlled (\\<150/100 mmHg).\n* Ejection Fraction \\> 50% by echocardiogram. (LVEF greater than 75% at baseline should be reviewed and/or the test repeated as it may be falsely elevated).\n* No history of thrombosis during the previous 12 months.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Current, recent (within 4 weeks of the first infusion of this study), or planned participation in an experimental drug study other than this sponsor-investigator Bevacizumab cancer study.\n* Uncontrolled high blood pressure (\\>150/100 mmHg).\n* Unstable angina\n* New York Heart Association (NYHA) Grade III or greater congestive heart failure\n* History of myocardial infarction or unstable angina within 12 months\n* History of stroke or TIA within 12 months\n* Clinically significant peripheral vascular disease\n* History of a bleeding disorder\n* Presence of central nervous system or brain metastases\n* Major surgical procedure, open biopsy, or significant traumatic injury within 28 days prior to Day 0, anticipation of need for major surgical procedure during the course of the study\n* Minor surgical procedures (excluding fine needle aspirations or core biopsies) within 5 days prior to Day 0\n* Pregnant (positive pregnancy test) or lactating\n* Urine protein: creatinine ratio greater than or equal to 1.0 at screening or patients demonstrating \\> 1 gr of protein in 24 hr urine collection within 4 weeks prior to study entry will not participate in the trial.\n* History of abdominal fistula, gastrointestinal perforation, or intra-abdominal abscess within 6 months prior to Day 0\n* Serious, non-healing wound, ulcer, or bone fracture\n* Unwilling or unable to comply with the protocol for the duration of the study.\n* Psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements.\n* History of another malignancy within the last five years except non-melanoma skin cancer and carcinoma in-situ of uterine cervix.\n* Patients with metastatic disease.",
