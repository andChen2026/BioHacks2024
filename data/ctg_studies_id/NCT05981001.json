    "eligibilityCriteria": "Inclusion Criteria:\n\nIn order to be eligible for participation in this trial, the participant must:\n\n1. Have signed the informed consent to study participation.\n2. Be a female subject and aged between 18 and 70 years.\n3. Have locally advanced or recurrent inoperable HER2-negative breast cancer (Stage IIIB\\~IIIC) which cannot be treated with curative intent OR have metastatic breast cancer (Stage IV). HER2-negative breast cancer is defined by the most recent ASCO/CAP guidelines. Participants should appear clinically stable in the opinion of the investigator.\n4. Participants with estrogen receptor (ER)-positive and/or progesterone receptor (PR)-positive breast cancer have failed at least one line of hormonal therapy or CDK4/6 inhibitor, or are appropriate candidates for chemotherapy. Participants with ER-positive and/or PR-positive breast cancer may have received unlimited prior chemotherapy. Participants with triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) may have received unlimited prior treatments for breast cancer.\n5. Have not received the chemotherapeutic drugs and immune checkpoint inhibitor intended to be used in this study in the prior treatments for the Stage IIIB, IIIC or IV breast cancer. Participants who received the same chemotherapeutic drugs and/or immune checkpoint inhibitor in the (neo)adjuvant setting as in this study are eligible, only if \u226512 months have elapsed between the completion of treatment with curative intent (e.g., date of primary breast tumor surgery or date of last adjuvant chemotherapy administration, whichever occurred last) and the enrollment of this study.\n6. Have not received any prior adoptive cell therapy.\n7. Be suitable for treatment with nab-paclitaxel or gemcitabine/carboplatin and camrelizumab as judged by the investigator.\n8. Have accessible tumor-draining lymph nodes by surgery to grow LNL.\n9. Have measurable disease based on RECIST 1.1. Target lesions situated in a previously irradiated area are considered measurable, only if they have shown unequivocal progression based on RECIST 1.1 after radiation therapy.\n10. Have provided recently or newly obtained biopsy from a locally advanced or recurrent inoperable or metastatic tumor lesion for pathological examination of molecular subtype and PD-L1 expression, unless contraindicated due to site inaccessibility and/or participant safety concerns.\n11. Have an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1.\n12. Have life expectancy \u22654 months.\n13. Demonstrate adequate normal organ function:\n\n    NOTE: Blood component or cytokine therapy is not allowed within 14 days before surgery.\n    1.

Liver function test:\n\n       * AST and ALT \u22642.5 \u00d7ULN (\u22645\u00d7ULN for participants with liver metastases)\n       * ALP \u22642.5 \u00d7ULN (\u22645\u00d7ULN for participants with liver or bone metastases)\n       * Total bilirubin \u22641.5\u00d7ULN (\u22643.0 mg/dL for participants with Gilbert's syndrome)\n    3. Renal function test:\n\n       \u2022 Calculated creatinine clearance (CrCL) \u226545 mL/min OR creatinine \u22641.5 \u00d7 ULN\n    4. Coagulation function test:\n\n       * APTT \u22641.5 \u00d7ULN\n       * INR or PT \u22641.5\u00d7ULN\n    5. Doppler echocardiography:\n\n       \u2022 Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) \u226550%\n    6. Pulmonary function test:\n\n       * FEV1\u226560%\n14. Female participants of childbearing potential must be willing to use an adequate method of contraception for the course of the study through one year (or longer as specified by local institutional guidelines) after the last dose of study treatment. Female subjects of childbearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test within 7 days prior to LNL infusion.\n15. Have a specified washout period from prior anticancer therapies to the enrollment:\n\n    * Angiogenesis inhibitors: 4 weeks\n    * Chemotherapy or targeted therapy: 3 weeks\n    * Radiotherapy: 2 weeks\n    * Hormonal therapy: one week\n16. Have recovered from prior therapy-related adverse events to Grade\u22641 per CTCAE version 5.0 criteria or met the criteria of normal organ function specified above, except for second-degree peripheral nerve injury, alopecia, leukoderma, hypothyroidism controlled by thyroid hormone replacement therapy, type 1 diabetes controlled by insulin therapy, and other irreversible toxic events that would not be exacerbated by LNL infusion as judged by the investigator (e.g., hearing loss).\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\nThe participant must be excluded from participating in this trial if the participant:\n\n1. Has rapidly progressing tumors, as judged by the investigator.\n2. Has known active CNS metastases and/or carcinomatous meningitis except for previously treated and radiographically stable CNS metastases, or CNS metastases without medication requirement and corticosteroid dependence. To demonstrate radiographic stability of brain metastases, a minimum of 2 post-treatment brain imaging assessments are required: (1) The first brain imaging must be acquired after treatment of brain metastases has been completed; (2) The second brain imaging must be obtained during screening and 4 weeks after the previous post-treatment brain imaging.\n3.

Participants with previously treated spinal cord compression may participate provided that the compression-related symptoms are relieved within more than one week prior to surgery for tumor-draining lymph nodes.\n4. Has uncontrolled pleural effusion, pericardial effusion or ascites. Participants with indwelling catheter may participate.\n5. Has uncontrolled cancer pain as judged by the investigator. Participants requiring pain medication must have a treatment plan before enrollment. Symptomatic lesions suitable for palliative radiotherapy should be treated before enrollment.\n6.
