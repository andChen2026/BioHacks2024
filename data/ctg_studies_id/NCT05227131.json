    "eligibilityCriteria": "Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Patients must meet all of the following inclusion criteria to be eligible for enrollment into the study:\n\n  1. Signed Informed Consent Form (ICF) prior to participation in any study-related activities.\n  2. Male or female patients \u2265 18 years of age at the time of signing ICF.\n  3. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status of 0 or 1.\n  4. Life expectancy of \u2265 16 weeks.\n  5. Histologically confirmed HER2-positive breast cancer according to American Society of Clinical Oncology/College of American Pathologists (ASCO/CAP) guidelines 2018 based on local testing on the most recent analyzed biopsy.\n\n     Note: Central confirmation of HER2-positive status is not required for study entry. However, tissue blocks, or slides, must be submitted to confirm HER2 positivity by a Sponsor-designated central laboratory retrospectively.\n  6. Tumors may be estrogen receptor (ER)/progesterone receptor (PgR) positive or negative.\n  7. Disease progression after last systemic therapy documented by computerized tomography (CT) scan or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).\n\n     Note: Exclusive tumor marker elevation will not be considered sufficient for diagnosis of disease progression.\n  8. Centrally confirmed low affinity CD16A germline genotype (F/F or F/V).\n  9. Measurable disease as per RECIST v.1.1 criteria.\n  10. Have received treatment with at least one, and no more than three, HER2-targeting treatment regimens overall for unresectable locally advanced or MBC. Earlier adjuvant or neoadjuvant HER2-targeted therapy for more limited disease will be considered as one of the required prior regimens if the development of unresectable locally advanced or metastatic disease occurred within a 6-month period of time after completion of anti-HER2 therapy. In any case, patients must have received prior treatment with any anti-HER2 antibody drug conjugate (ADC) in the (neo)adjuvant or metastatic setting.\n\n      Note: Eligible patients must have progressed on or following, the most recent line of therapy. Dose interruptions, delays, pauses during previous therapy, or changes in therapy to manage toxicity will not constitute a new line of therapy provided disease progression did not occur.\n  11. Willingness and ability to provide a tumor biopsy at study entry and after progression from either metastatic or primary tissues in order to perform exploratory studies. If not feasible, patient eligibility should be evaluated by a Sponsor's qualified designee.\n\n      Note: Subjects for whom tumor biopsy cannot be obtained (e.g., inaccessible tumor or subject safety concern) may submit archival pathological material from either metastatic or primary sites, but the most recent tumor biopsy from the patient should be obtained when available at both timepoints.\n  12. Central nervous system (CNS) metastases inclusion; based on screening brain imaging (CT or MRI), patients must have one of the following:\n\n      1. No evidence of brain metastases;\n      2. Untreated and asymptomatic CNS metastases not needing immediate local therapy. Patients with untreated lesions \\>2.0 cm on screening contrast brain MRI, require analysis and approval from the medical monitor prior to enrollment.\n      3. Patients with history of CNS lesions assessable by RECIST v1.1 are eligible if they have been definitively treated with local therapy, are non-progressing, and off anticonvulsants and steroids. A specific washout period from the end of local therapy for CNS lesions to the first dose of study treatment is mandatory (one week for stereotactic radiosurgery, three weeks for whole brain radiation therapy, and four weeks for surgical resection).\n  13. Resolution of all acute toxic effects of prior anti-cancer therapy to grade \u2264 1 as determined by the National Cancer Institute-Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v.5.0 criteria (except for alopecia or other toxicities not considered a safety risk for the patient at Investigator's discretion).\n  14. Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of \\>50% as assessed by echocardiogram (ECHO) or multi-gated acquisition scan (MUGA) scan documented within 28 days prior to first dose of study treatment.\n  15. Adequate hematologic and organ function within 28 days before the first study treatment on Cycle 1 Day 1, defined by the following:\n\n      1. Hematological: White blood cell (WBC) count \\> 3.0 x 109/L, absolute neutrophil count (ANC) \\> 1.5 x 109/L, platelet count \u2265 100 x 103/\u03bcL (patients with stable platelet count from 75-100 x 103/\u03bcL may be included with approval by the medical monitor), and hemoglobin (Hb) \\> 9.0 g/dL.\n      2. Hepatic: Serum albumin \u2265 3 g/dL; Total bilirubin \u2264 1.5 times the upper limit of normal (\u00d7 ULN) (\u2264 3 x ULN in the case of Gilbert's disease); aspartate transaminase (AST) and alanine transaminase (ALT) \u2264 2.5 \u00d7 ULN (in the case of liver metastases \u2264 5 \u00d7 ULN); alkaline phosphatase (ALP) \u2264 2.5 \u00d7 ULN (\u2264 5 \u00d7 ULN in the case of liver and/or bone metastases).\n      3. Renal: Serum creatinine \\< 1.5 \u00d7 ULN or creatinine clearance \u2265 50 mL/min based on Cockcroft-Gault glomerular filtration rate estimation.\n      4. International normalized ratio (INR) and activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) \u2264 1.5 x ULN unless on medication known to alter INR and/or aPTT.\n  16. For women of childbearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test at 1 week prior to the start of treatment and a further confirmation test on Day 1 (C1D1) before receiving the first dose, and must agree to remain abstinent (refrain from heterosexual intercourse) or to use a medically acceptable method of contraception during the study and up to 7 months after the last dose of study drug, and agree to refrain from donating eggs during this same period.\n  17. Men with female partners of childbearing potential must remain abstinent or use a medically acceptable method of contraception during the treatment period and up to 7 months after the last dose of study drug.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Patients will be excluded from the study if they meet any of the following criteria:\n\n  1.

Prior exposure to margetuximab, capecitabine or other fluoropyrimidine \\[e.g., 5-fluorouracil\\] or any HER2 tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) tucatinib, and/or dual HER2/epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) TKIs (lapatinib, neratinib, afatinib, etc.) except for the following conditions:\n\n     1. Lapatinib at least 12 months prior to starting study treatment (except in cases where lapatinib was given for \u2264 21 days and was discontinued for reasons other than disease progression or severe toxicity);\n     2. Patients who have received capecitabine for adjuvant or neoadjuvant treatment at least 12 months prior to starting study treatment are eligible (except in cases where capecitabine was given for \u2264 21 days and was discontinued for reasons other than disease progression or severe toxicity).\n  3. Presence of carcinomatous meningitis or leptomeningeal disease.\n  4. Extracranial radiation therapy within 14 days (seven days for limited-field palliative radiotherapy) prior to study enrolment, or patients who have not recovered from radiotherapy-related toxicities to grade \u2264 1.\n  5.

Patients have a concurrent malignancy or malignancy within five years of study enrollment with the exception of carcinoma in situ of the cervix, non-melanoma skin carcinoma, or stage I uterine cancer. For other cancers considered to have a low risk of recurrence, discussion with the Sponsor's Medical Monitor is required.\n  7.
