    "eligibilityCriteria": "\\*This list is representative of study inclusion/exclusion criteria. Each substudy may include variations on these criteria.\n\nInclusion Criteria:\n\n1. Ability and willingness to comply with the study's visit and assessment schedule.\n2. Male or female \u2265 18 years of age at Visit 1 (Screening).\n3. Pathologic diagnosis of \\[solid tumors\\] indicated in the relevant substudy(ies).\n4. Ability and willingness to provide written informed consent. Voluntary written consent must be given before performance of any study related procedure not part of standard medical care, with the understanding that consent may be withdrawn by the patient at any time without prejudice to future medical care.\n5. At least one lesion (primary tumor, recurrent tumor, or metastatic lymph node) that is surface accessible for CIVO injection that contains viable minimum tumor tissue volume and characteristics (e.g., based on clinical evaluation, available pre-operative imaging, pre-injection ultrasound imaging, or pathology reports indicating lesion with appropriate viable tumor volume without excessive cysts or necrosis) and for which there is a planned surgical intervention. The patient's presentation, surgical and pathology plan may determine whether a lesion is eligible with respect to a given CIVO MID needle configuration.\n6. Female patients who:\n\n   * Are postmenopausal for at least one year before the screening visit, OR\n   * Are surgically sterile, OR\n   * Are of childbearing potential who agree to practice a highly effective method of contraception from the time of signing the Informed Consent Form (ICF) and during study participation OR agree to completely abstain from heterosexual intercourse.\n   * Agree to refrain from donating ova during study participation.\n\nMale patients, even if surgically sterile (i.e., status post-vasectomy), who:\n\n* Agree to practice effective barrier contraception from the time of signing the ICF and during study participation OR agree to completely abstain from heterosexual intercourse.\n* Agree to refrain from donating sperm during study participation.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n1. Tumors near or involving critical structures for which, in the opinion of the treating clinician, injection would pose undue risk to the patient.\n2. Female patients who are:\n\n   * Both lactating and breastfeeding, OR\n   * Have a positive \u03b2-subunit human chorionic gonadotropin (\u03b2-hCG) pregnancy test at screening verified by the Investigator.\n3. Any uncontrolled intercurrent illness, condition, serious medical or psychiatric illness, or circumstance that, in the opinion of the Investigator, could interfere with adherence to the study's procedures or requirements, or otherwise compromise the study's objectives.",
