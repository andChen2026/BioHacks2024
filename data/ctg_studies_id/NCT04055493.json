OR: Pre-menopausal patients:\n* confirmed negative serum pregnancy test (\u03b2-hCG) before starting study treatment, or\n* patient has had a hysterectomy. 5. Histologically confirmed diagnosis of primary estrogen-receptor positive and/or progesterone-receptor positive (\\> 1%) early breast cancer by local laboratory.\n\n  6. Patient has HER2-negative breast cancer defined as\n* a negative in-situ hybridization test or an IHC status of 0, 1+, or 2+,\n* if IHC is 2+, a negative in-situ hybridization (FISH, CISH, or SISH) test is required (based on the most recently analyzed tissue sample and all tested by a local laboratory).\n\n  7. Local therapy of breast cancer (if adjuvant treatment or planned if neoadjuvant treatment) according to current guidelines.\n\nNote: This may include radiotherapy of breast cancer.\n\nB. Prior to RANDOMIZATION in the study 8. No evidence of distant metastasis (confirmed prior to randomization by, preferentially, CT thorax / abdomen, X-ray chest, ultrasound liver, bone scan, or PET-CT).\n\n9. Patient has available tumor tissue from diagnostic biopsy. 10. Patient is classified as intermediate risk according to the ADAPT intermediate-risk definition (i) (as follows), or (only in case of missing Oncotype DX or Ki-67 response data), according to the clinical intermediate-risk definition (ii) (as follows).\n\n(i). ADAPT intermediate-risk definition: Patient meets one of the following criteria:\n\n* c/pN0, RS \u2264 25 with luminal-B-like (Ki-67 \u226520% or G3) or c/pT2-4 without endocrine response (post-endocrine Ki-67 \\> 10 %)\n* c/pN1, RS \u2264 25 without endocrine response (post-endocrine Ki-67 \\> 10 %)\n* c/pN0, RS \\> 25 with luminal-B-like (Ki-67 \u226520% or G3) or c/pT2-4 with endocrine response (Ki-67 \u2264 10 %)\n* c/pN1, RS \\> 25 with endocrine response (Ki-67 \u2264 10 %)\n* c/pN2-3, RS \u2264 25 with endocrine response (Ki-67 \u2264 10 %). Note: Postmenopausal patients with pT1-2/pN0 disease and RS \\< 25, as well as premenopausal patients with pT1-2/pN0 disease and RS\\<16, are recommended to be treated by endocrine therapy alone and not to be randomized (at investigator\u00b4s discretion).\n\n(ii).
