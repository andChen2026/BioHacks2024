Patient is pregnant or breast feeding or is of reproductive potential and not employing an effective method of birth control.\n\n    * Note: Double barrier contraceptives must be used through the trial by both sexes. Oral, implantable, or injectable contraceptives may be affected by cytochrome P450 interactions, and are therefore not considered effective for this study. Women of child-bearing potential, defined as sexually mature women who have not undergone a hysterectomy or who have not been naturally postmenopausal for at least 12 consecutive months (i.e., who has had menses any time in the preceding 12 consecutive months), must have a negative serum pregnancy test \u2264 72 hours prior to initiating treatment.\n    * Note: Women are considered post-menopausal and not of child bearing potential if they have had 12 months of natural (spontaneous) amenorrhea with an appropriate clinical profile (e.g. age appropriate, history of vasomotor symptoms) or six months of spontaneous amenorrhea with serum FSH levels \\> 40 mIU/mL \\[for US only: and estradiol \\< 20 pg/mL\\] or have had surgical bilateral oophorectomy (with or without hysterectomy) at least six weeks ago. In the case of oophorectomy alone, only when the reproductive status of the woman has been confirmed by follow up hormone level assessment is she considered not of child bearing potential.\n    * Note: Women of child-bearing potential, defined as all women physiologically capable of becoming pregnant, must use highly effective contraception during treatment for 4 weeks (5 T1/2) after stopping treatment. The highly effective contraception is defined as either:\n\n      i. True abstinence: When this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the subject. Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, post-ovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception.\n\n    ii. Sterilization: have had surgical bilateral oophorectomy (with or without hysterectomy) or tubal ligation at least six weeks ago. In case of oophorectomy alone, only when the reproductive status of the woman has been confirmed by follow up hormone level assessment.\n\n    iii. Male partner sterilization (with the appropriate post-vasectomy documentation of the absence of sperm in the ejaculate). For female subjects on the study, the vasectomised male partner should be the sole partner for that patient.\n\n    iv. Use of a combination of any two of the following (a+b):\n    1. Placement of an intrauterine device (IUD) or intrauterine system (IUS)\n    2. Barrier methods of contraception: Condom or Occlusive cap (diaphragm or cervical/vault caps) with spermicidal foam/gel/film/cream/vaginal suppository\n\n       * Oral contraception, injected or implanted hormonal methods are not allowed as BKM120 potentially decreases the effectiveness of hormonal contraceptives.\n25. Patient has known diagnosis of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection\n26. Patient has history of another malignancy within 5 years, except cured basal cell carcinoma of the skin or excised carcinoma in situ of the cervix\n27.
