Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) \u2265 1.5 x 109/L.\n  2. Hemoglobin (Hb) \u22659 g/dl (transfusion or use of EPO is permitted).\n  3. Platelets \\> 100,000/mm3\n  4. Creatinine \u2264 1.5 x normal value based on the Cock Gault (CG) equation.\n  5. AST or ALT \u2264 2.5 x ULN (or \u22645 x ULN in case of liver metastasis)\n  6. Alkaline phosphatase \u22642.5 x ULN. Alkaline phosphatase may be more than 2.5 x ULN only in the case of bone metastases, and AST and ALT less than 1.5 x ULN.\n  7. Total bilirubin \u22641.5 mg/dl (higher bilirubin levels are permitted if the patient has Gilbert's syndrome).\n\nBaseline LVEF \u226550% measured using echocardiogram or equilibrium\n\nisotopic ventriculography (MUGA).\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* \u2022 Serum creatinine \\>3.0 mg/dL (270 \u03bcM/L)\n\n  * Hepatic enzyme levels more than 5 times upper limit of normal.\n  * Known severe allergy or hypersensitivity to IV radiographic contrast.\n  * Use of any other investigational product or device within 30 days prior to dosing or known requirement for any other investigational agent prior to completion of all scheduled study assessments.\n  * Patients with a body weight of 400 pounds or more or not able to enter the bore of the PET/CT scanner due to BMI, because of the compromise in image quality with CT, PET/CT and MRI that will result.\n  * Inability to lie still for the entire imaging time (e.g. cough, severe arthritis, etc.).\n  * Inability to complete the needed investigational and standard-of-care imaging examinations due to other reasons (severe claustrophobia, radiation phobia, etc.)\n  * Recognized concurrent active infection (e.g., HIV)\n  * Previous Grade 3 or higher allergic reaction to Trastuzumab that resulted in discontinuation of Trastuzumab therapy. Any additional medical condition, serious intercurrent illness, or other extenuating circumstance that, in the opinion of the Investigator, may significantly interfere with study compliance.\n\n    * Adult patients who require monitored anesthesia for PET scanning",
