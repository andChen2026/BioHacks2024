No chemotherapy or radiotherapy may be given within 2 weeks prior to the start of protocol treatment.\n* Patients must be \u2265 18 and \\< 80 years old.\n* Performance Status: Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) 0-2.\n* Life expectancy of greater than 12 weeks.\n* Patients must have recovered from uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris or cardiac arrhythmia.\n* Required Laboratory Values: Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) \u22651,250/mm3, platelets \u226575,000/mm3, hemoglobin \u22658.5 g/dL, total bilirubin \u22641.5 x ULN, Aspartate Aminotransferase (AST)/Alanine Aminotransferase (ALT) \u22643.0 x ULN, alkaline phosphatase \u22642.5 x ULN, Patients must have either a normal serum creatinine (\\<= IULN) OR estimated creatinine clearance \u2265 60 ml/min (Cockcroft-Gault formula) within 14 days prior to registration.\n* Concomitant Medications: Erlotinib is primarily metabolized by CYP3A4. Patients CANNOT be receiving enzyme-inducing or enzyme inhibiting agents listed here: Inhibitors: Amiodarone, Amprenavir, Atazanavir, Chloramphenicol, Clarithromycin, Conivaptan, Cyclosporine, Darunavir, Dasatinib, Delavirdine, Diltiazem, Erythromycin, Fluconazole, Fluoxetine, Fluvoxamine, Fosamprenavir, Imatinib, Indinavir, Isoniazid, Itraconazole, Ketoconazole, Lapatinib, Miconazole, Nefazodone, Nelfinavir, Posaconazole, Ritonavir, Quinupristin, Saquinavir, Tamoxifen, Telithromycin, Troleandomycin, Verapamil, Voriconazole. Inducers: Aminoglutethimide, Bexarotene, Bosentan, Carbamazepine, Efavirenz, Fosphenytoin, Griseofulvin, Modafinil, Nafcillin, Nevirapine, Oxcarbazepine, Phenobarbital, Phenytoin, Primidone, Rifabutin, Rifampin, Rifapentine, St. John's wort, Sulfadimidine, Sulfinpyrazone, Troglitazone, Troleandomycin. All concomitant medications must be recorded.\n* Sexually Active Patients: For all sexually active patients, the use of adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control) will be required prior to study entry and for the duration of study participation. The non-pregnant status will be determined in all women of childbearing potential.\n* Patients must have signed an approved informed consent.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Active central nervous system (CNS) disease\n\n  a. Subjects with a history of CNS metastases or cord compression are allowable if they have been clinically stable for at least 6 weeks since completion of definitive treatment, are off steroids (if the steroids were part of the CNS disease treatment), and in the case of brain metastases, have stable or improved imaging at least 6 weeks after completion of their definitive treatment.\n* Any serious medical or psychiatric illness that would prevent either the giving of informed consent or the receipt of treatment.\n* Patients pregnant or nursing.\n* Patients who have used tobacco or nicotine products or medications within the last three months given their significant effect on erlotinib drug levels.\n* Diabetes. Defined as HgbA1C \u2265 6.5%.\n* Prior metformin treatment OR EGFR targeted therapy.\n* Rapidly progressive disease as judged by the investigator (Examples include rapidly deteriorating performance status or symptomatic lymphangitic spread).\n* Patient has any condition associated with increased risk of metformin-associated lactic acidosis (e.g. congestive heart failure defined as New York Heart Association (NYHA) Class III or IV functional status, history of acidosis of any type; habitual intake of 3 or more alcoholic beverages per day).",
