Prior palliative radiotherapy to metastatic lesion(s) is permitted, provided it has been completed 7 days prior to study enrollment and no clinically significant toxicities are expected (e.g., mucositis, esophagitis).\n  * Major surgery within 21 days prior to the first study drug administration (exception: participants may enroll if fully recovered or without intolerable or clinically significant adverse effects but at least 14 days must have elapsed between major surgery and first study drug administration)\n* Known symptomatic brain metastases requiring the use of systemic corticosteroids \u226510 mg/day prednisone or equivalents. Asymptomatic and treated, or asymptomatic untreated brain metastases are allowed as long as participants are clinically stable. Stable doses of anticonvulsants are allowed.\n* Any condition that impairs a participant's ability to swallow whole pills. Impairment of gastrointestinal function (GI) or GI disease or other condition at baseline that will interfere significantly with the absorption, distribution, or metabolism of AC699.",
