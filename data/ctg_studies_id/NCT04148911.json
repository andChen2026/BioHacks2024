with expected curative outcome\n\nGeneral Medical Exclusion Criteria:\n\n* Pregnancy or lactation\n* Evidence of significant uncontrolled concomitant disease that could affect compliance with the protocol or interpretation of results, including significant liver disease\n* Significant cardiovascular disease such as New York Heart Association (NYHA) cardiac disease (Class II or greater), myocardial infarction within 3 months prior to the first dose of study treatment (Cycle 1, Day 1), unstable arrhythmias, or unstable angina\n* Severe infection within 4 weeks prior to the first dose of study treatment (Cycle 1, Day 1), including but not limited to hospitalization for complications of infection, bacteraemia, or severe pneumonia, or any active infection, that in the opinion of the investigator, could impact patient safety.\n* Treatment with oral or IV antibiotics within 2 weeks prior to initiation of study treatment (Cycle 1, Day 1)\n* Major surgical procedure within 28 days prior to the first dose of study treatment (Cycle 1, Day 1), or anticipation of the need for a major surgical procedure during the course of the study (other than diagnostic procedures)\n* Treatment

hypersensitivity to paclitaxel or any of the excipients, when paclitaxel is used as a backbone taxane\n* Positive human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) test at screening, unless the patient meets all of the following conditions: stable on anti-retroviral therapy, CD4 count \u2265200/mL, undetectable viral load\n* Any other disease, metabolic dysfunction, physical examination finding, or clinical laboratory finding that contraindicates the use of an investigational drug, may affect the interpretation of the results, or may render the patient at high risk from treatment complications\n\nExclusion Criteria Related to Atezolizumab:\n\n* History of severe allergic, anaphylactic, or other hypersensitivity reactions to chimeric or humanized antibodies or fusion proteins\n* Known hypersensitivity or allergy to biopharmaceuticals produced in Chinese hamster ovary cells or any component of the atezolizumab formulation\n* Prior allogenic stem cell or solid organ
