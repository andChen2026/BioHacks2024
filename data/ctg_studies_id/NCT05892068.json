Subjects with known history of Gilbert's Syndrome and normal direct bilirubin, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) are eligible: AST and ALT \u22642.5 \u00d7 ULN (\u22645 \u00d7 ULN if liver metastases are present)\n  3. Calculated creatinine clearance \u226550 mL/min using the CKD-EPI (2021) (in Cohort A, in patients with elevated serum creatinine, eGFR can be calculated using cystatin C to confirm eligibility)\n  4. International normalized ratio (INR) and activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) \u22641.5 \u00d7 ULN unless on medication known to alter INR and/or aPTT\n* Women of childbearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test performed within 7 days prior to enrollment and must agree to use adequate contraception prior to enrollment and for the duration of study participation\n* Patients must be able to swallow and retain oral medication\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Contraindications or history of allergic reaction to tucatinib or any of its excipients\n* Significant medical co-morbidities as per investigator evaluation\n* Inability to comply with protocol and /or not willing or not available for follow-up assessments or any condition which in the investigator's opinion makes the patient unsuitable for the study participation\n* Have used a strong or moderate CYP2C8 inhibitor within 5 half-lives of the inhibitor or have used a strong or moderate CYP2C8 or CYP3A4 inducer within 2 weeks prior to first dose of study treatment (Appendix E)\n* Receiving concomitant CYP3A or P-gp substrates where minimal concentration changes may lead to serious or life-threatening toxicities\n* Concurrent pregnancy",
