Adequate renal function as evidenced by a serum creatinine level \u2264 1.5 \u00d7 ULN (subjects with a serum creatinine level \\>1.5 x ULN with a calculated creatinine clearance \\> 50 mL/min according to Cockcroft-Gault equation will be eligible).\n16.

Primary CNS malignancies or CNS metastases; subjects with previously treated brain metastasis will be allowed if the brain metastasis has been stable without steroid treatment for at least 3 months following prior treatment (radiotherapy or surgery). Subjects with symptoms of CNS metastases or history must have a CT or MRI scan including the brain during Screening.\n\n  2. Significant cardiovascular disease, including:\n\n  \u2022 Active clinically symptomatic left ventricular failure\n  * Uncontrolled hypertension: Systolic blood pressure \\> 140 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure \\>90 mmHg on 2 or more antihypertensive medications. Note: Initiation or adjustment of antihypertensive medication(s) is permitted during the screening period, in order to control a subject's BP prior to initiating treatment. Blood pressure must be re-assessed on two occasions that are separated by a minimum of 1 hour. The SBP / DBP values from each blood pressure assessment must be \u2264 140/90 mmHg in order for a subject to be eligible for the study\n  * Myocardial infarction, severe or unstable angina within 6 months prior to administration of first dose of study drug\n  * History of serious ventricular arrhythmia (ie, ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation)\n  * Cardiac arrhythmias requiring anti-arrhythmic medications\n  * History of coronary or peripheral artery bypass graft within 6 months\n\n    3.

Treatment with radiotherapy (limited radiotherapy involving \u2264 25% of bone marrow may be allowed for palliative purposes after consultation with the medical monitor. Treatment with study drugs (tivozanib and capecitabine) must be stopped during radiotherapy).\n4. Herbal preparations/supplements (including daily multivitamin/mineral supplement containing herbal components).\n5. Treatment with full dose oral anticoagulants such as warfarin, acenocoumarol, fenprocoumon, or similar agents. If previously receiving these types of agents, a minimum washout of 1 week and documented INR of \u2264 1.5 will be required prior to start of therapy. Full dose anticoagulation with low molecular weight heparin or unfractionated heparin administered subcutaneously is allowed. Low dose oral anticoagulation (eg, 1-2 mg/day warfarin) is allowed provided INR remains \u2264 1.5 during the study.",
