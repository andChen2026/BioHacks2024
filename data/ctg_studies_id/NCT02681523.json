Patients must have had prior treatment with an anthracycline and a taxane (either sequential or in combination) unless patients were not suitable for these treatments. This treatment can be in the adjuvant setting\n* 7. Measurable sites of locally advanced and/or metastatic disease that can be accurately assessed by CT/MRI scan at baseline (RECIST v1.1)\u00b9\n* 8. Life expectancy of \u22656 months\n* 9.

Premenopausal if has been subject to ovarian ablation/ suppression at least 3 weeks prior to commencing AI therapy\n\n  * RECIST v1.1 updated and now considers bone metastasis with an identifiable soft tissue mass to be measurable disease. Therefore, patients with bone metastasis are eligible, provided they have evaluable disease.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* 1.Triple negative or Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor 2 (HER2) positive cancer\n* 2. Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of its excipients\n* 3. History of another primary malignancy within 5 years prior to starting study treatment, except adequately treated basal or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin, carcinoma in site and the disease under study\n* 4. Evidence of uncontrolled active infection\n* 5. Severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh C)\n* 6.
