    "eligibilityCriteria": "Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Required tumor parameters for node positive disease: NOTE: This study will continue to use the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) 5th edition for TNM classification and staging\n\n  * Operable, histologically confirmed adenocarcinoma of the female breast and positive lymph nodes\n\n    * Node positivity may be determined by either an axillary node dissection or a positive sentinel node finding by hematoxylin and eosin (H\\&E)\n\n      * NOTE: Positive nodes refers to H\\&E visible nodal metastases; immunohistochemistry (IHC) positive only cells in lymph nodes will not be considered positive nodes\n    * One or more positive lymph nodes whose tumors are T1-3, pN1-2, M0 are eligible\n    * cN2 disease is not eligible\n    * pN2 disease is eligible\n    * One positive lymph node by sentinel node biopsy or at least 6 axillary nodes must be examined on axillary node dissection with at least one positive lymph node\n    * Metaplastic carcinoma is eligible\n  * ER/PgR determination\n  * HER-2 positive (pre-entry requirement for registration)\n\n    * FISH must show gene amplification OR\n    * IHC assay must show a strong positive (3+) staining score\n\n      * NOTE: ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) components should not be counted in the determination of degree of IHC staining or FISH amplification\n* Required tumor parameters for high-risk node-negative disease; NOTE: This study will continue to use the AJCC 5th edition for TNM classification and staging\n\n  * Operable, histologically confirmed adenocarcinoma of the female breast and negative lymph nodes\n\n    * Node status may be determined by either axillary node dissection or sentinel node biopsy with H\\&E staining; to be considered node negative, either of the following must be true: 1) negative sentinel node biopsy or 2) no positive lymph nodes found among at least 6 axillary nodes examined on axillary node dissection\n    * NOTE: IHC positive only cells in lymph nodes will not be considered positive nodes\n    * Tumors \\> 2.0 cm (irrespective of hormonal receptor status) or \\> 1.0 cm if ER-negative and PR-negative disease\n  * ER/PgR determination\n  * HER-2 positive (pre-entry requirement for registration)\n\n    * FISH must show gene amplification OR\n    * IHC assay must show a strong positive (3+) staining score\n\n      * NOTE: DCIS components should not be counted in the determination of degree of IHC staining or FISH amplification\n* =\\< 84 days from mastectomy or =\\< 84 days from axillary dissection or sentinel node detection if the patient's most extensive breast surgery was a breast sparing procedure; (This timing is per a decision by the Breast Intergroup)\n* Surgical resection margins. All tumor should be removed by either a modified radical mastectomy or a segmental mastectomy with axillary node dissection\n\n  * Mastectomy: There will be no evidence of gross or microscopic tumor (invasive or DCIS) at the surgical resection margins noted in the final surgery or pathology reports; patients with close margins are eligible\n  * Segmental mastectomy (lumpectomy): Margins must be clear of invasive cancer and DCIS\n  * Axillary dissection or sentinel node dissection: There will be no gross residual adenopathy\n* TAM therapy\n\n  * May have received up to four weeks of TAM therapy, or any other hormonal agent, for this malignancy\n  * May have received TAM or raloxifene for purposes of chemoprevention (e.g., Breast Cancer Prevention Trial) or for other indications (including previous breast cancer if lobular carcinoma in situ \\[LCIS\\]) but must be discontinued before registration on this study\n  * May never have received TAM, raloxifene, or any other hormonal agent\n* Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) \\>= 1500/mm\\^3\n* Platelets (PLT) \\>= 100,000/mm\\^3\n* Total bilirubin =\\< 1.5 x upper normal limit (UNL)\n* Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) =\\< 2.0 x UNL\n* Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) within institutional normal range; if LVEF is \\> 75%, the investigator should consider performing a second review of the multigated acquisition (MUGA)/echocardiogram or performing a repeat MUGA/echocardiogram prior to registration; such re-reviews or repeat MUGA/echocardiogram are not permitted after registration\n* Willingness to discontinue sex hormonal therapy, e.g., birth control pills, ovarian hormonal replacement therapy, etc., prior to registration and while on study\n* Willingness to discontinue any hormonal agent such as raloxifene (Evista) prior to registration and while on study\n* Non-breast malignancies that have not recurred within the last 5 years and are deemed to be at low risk for recurrence\n\nEXCEPTIONS: These non-breast malignancies are eligible even if diagnosed =\\< 5 years prior to registration:\n\n* Squamous or basal cell carcinoma of the skin that has been effectively treated\n* Carcinoma in situ of the cervix that has been treated by surgery only\n* Lobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS) of the ipsilateral or contralateral breast treated by surgery and/or tamoxifen only\n\n  * Patients undergoing breast conservation therapy (i.e., lumpectomy and axillary dissection) must have plans to receive radiation therapy to the breast +/- regional lymphatics following completion of the chemotherapy; for patients treated with mastectomy, the use of radiation therapy is required for 4 or more positive lymph nodes and must be started after completion of chemotherapy; the use of radiation therapy is at the discretion of the investigator for 0-3 positive lymph nodes but, if used, must be started after the completion of chemotherapy\n  * Prior to registration, the physician must designate if it is planned for the patient to receive radiation therapy (for adjuvant radiation therapy post-mastectomy or, less commonly, post-conservative therapy but not primary breast radiation as part of breast conserving treatment)\n  * Willing and able to sign an informed consent\n  * Gene amplified by FISH or strong positivity (3+) by HercepTest on central review; Note: The patient registers based on community HER-2 testing using FISH or IHC, AC chemotherapy is initiated; the tumor block or slides must be received =\\< 2 weeks from time of registration to the North Central Cancer Treatment Group (NCCTG) Operations Office for central HER-2 testing\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Any of the following:\n\n  * Pregnant women\n  * Nursing women\n  * Women of childbearing potential or their sexual partners who are unwilling to employ adequate contraception (condoms, diaphragm, intrauterine device \\[IUD\\], surgical sterilization, or abstinence, etc.); hormonal birth control methods are not permitted\n* Locally advanced tumors (classification T4) at diagnosis including tumors fixed to chest wall, peau d'orange, skin ulcerations/nodules, or clinical inflammatory changes (diffuse brawny cutaneous induration with an erysipeloid edge)\n* Prior history of breast cancer, except LCIS\n* Bilateral invasive carcinoma, either metachronous or synchronous (EXCEPTION: Patients diagnosed with unilateral invasive carcinoma and metachronous or synchronous DCIS of the contralateral breast treated with mastectomy are eligible)\n* Prior chemotherapy, radiation therapy, immunotherapy, or biotherapy for breast cancer\n* Active, unresolved infection\n* Active cardiac disease\n\n  * Any prior myocardial infarction\n  * History of documented congestive heart failure (CHF)\n  * Current use of digitalis or beta-blockers for CHF\n  * Any prior history of arrhythmia or cardiac valvular disease requiring medications or clinically significant\n  * Current use of medications for treatment of arrhythmias or angina pectoris\n  * Current uncontrolled hypertension (diastolic \\> 100 mmHg or systolic \\> 200 mmHg)\n  * Clinically significant pericardial effusion\n* Prior anthracycline or taxane therapy for any malignancy\n* Sensitivity to benzyl alcohol\n* Neurology/Neuropathy-Sensory \\>= grade 2 per the National Cancer Institute's (NCI's) Common Toxicity Criteria Version 2.0;
