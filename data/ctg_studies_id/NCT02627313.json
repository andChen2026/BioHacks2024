The absolute value of the boost PTV is \u2264 100 cc\n* Multifocal disease is allowed if it was removed by a single lumpectomy resection and the patient remained a candidate for breast conservation.\n* Women of childbearing potential must use an effective contraceptive method such as condom/diaphragm and spermicidal foam, intrauterine device (IUD), or prescription birth control pills. For these women of childbearing potential, a negative pregnancy test must be obtained prior to study enrollment or waiver signed.\n* The patient must weigh less than 150Kg (330lb), which is the limit of the imaging couch.\n* The patient must be less than 6'6\" in height.\n* The patient must feel comfortable in the prone position.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Patients with proven multi-centric carcinoma (tumors in different quadrants of the breast or tumor separated by at least 4 cm).\n* Prior radiation therapy above the umbilicus\n* Unable to fit into the immobilization breast cup with an adequate seal\n* Male gender.\n* Patient cannot comfortably be set up in the prone position (i.e. physical disability)\n* Unable to fit into the breast immobilization device due to breast size or other anatomical reason.\n* Mastectomy is the surgery performed.\n* Patient has received prior radiotherapy to the involved breast.\n* Regional nodal irradiation is part of the treatment plan.\n* Tumor bed is less than 5 mm from the skin surface.\n* Patients with skin involvement, regardless of tumor size.\n* Patients with connective tissue disorders specifically systemic lupus erythematosis, scleroderma, or dermatomyositis.\n* Patients with psychiatric or addictive disorders as indicated in their medical histories that would preclude obtaining informed consent.\n* Patients who are pregnant or lactating due to potential exposure of the fetus to RT and unknown effects of RT to lactating females.",
