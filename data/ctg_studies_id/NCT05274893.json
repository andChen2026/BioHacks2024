Patients have no pregnancy plan within 6 months after entering the study, voluntarily take effective contraceptive measures, and have no egg donation plan.\n9. Fully understand the purpose and requirements of this trial, and can complete the whole trial process according to the test requirements.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n1. Have severe allergy to paclitaxel drugs or human serum albumin, or history of significant hypersensitivity or idiosyncratic reaction.\n2. Patients with serious medical conditions are considered unsuitable for inclusion by the investigator.\n3. Patients who have undergone major surgery within 3 months prior to screening or planned to have major surgery during the study period.\n4. Have a history of alcohol, drug abuse or drug addiction.\n5.

According to the determination of the investigator, the washout period can be appropriately shortened or extended. If there are interfering monoclonal antibodies that require an appropriate extension of the washout period when necessary, or if other antitumor drugs need to be combined during the study.\n8.
