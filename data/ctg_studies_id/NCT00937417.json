docetaxel as monotherapy or in combination with other chemotherapeutic agents allowed provided there is potential clinical benefit present, in the investigator's opinion, from the combination of docetaxel and vandetanib\n* No prior vandetanib\n* No prior surgical procedures affecting absorption\n* More than 14 days since prior drugs with a short half-life (e.g., sorafenib or sunitinib)
