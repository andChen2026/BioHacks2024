Any electrocardiogram (ECG) abnormality, including pericarditis, which in the opinion of the Investigator would preclude safe participation in the study.\n* Active, uncontrolled bacterial, viral, or fungal infections within 7 days of study entry requiring systemic therapy. Participants with active TB infection are excluded from the study.\n* Known clinically important respiratory impairment\n* History of major organ transplant\n* History of an autologous or allogeneic bone marrow transplant\n* Serious non-malignant disease that could compromise protocol objectives in the opinion of the Investigator and/or the Sponsor\n* Pregnant or nursing women\n* Any systemic anticancer therapy within 3 weeks prior to Cycle 1 Day 1\n* Any radiation treatment to metastatic site within \\<= 14 days of Cycle 1 Day 1\n* Major surgical procedure, open biopsy, or significant traumatic injury within 30 days prior to Cycle 1 Day 1 or anticipation of need for major surgical procedure during the course of the study\n* History of severe allergic, anaphylactic, or other hypersensitivity reactions to chimeric, human or humanized antibodies or fusion proteins\n* Known hypersensitivity or allergy to biopharmaceuticals produced in Chinese hamster ovary cells or any component of the atezolizumab formulation\n* Active or history of autoimmune disease\n* History of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (including pneumonitis), drug-induced pneumonitis, organizing pneumonia (i.e., bronchiolitis obliterans, cryptogenic organizing pneumonia), or evidence of active pneumonitis on screening chest computed tomography (CT) scan. History of radiation pneumonitis in the radiation field (fibrosis) is permitted\n* Positive test for Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)\n* Active hepatitis B or hepatitis C\n* Receipt of a live, attenuated vaccine within 4 weeks prior to randomization or anticipation that such a live, attenuated vaccine will be required during the study\n* Treatment with investigational therapy within 28 days prior to initiation of study treatment\n* Treatment with therapeutic oral or IV antibiotics within 2 weeks prior to initiation of study treatment\n* Consumption of agents which strongly inhibit CYP3A4 enzyme, within 7 days prior to the first dose of study treatment and during the study\n* Consumption of agents which strongly induce CYP3A4 enzyme, within 14 days prior to the first dose of study treatment and during the study\n* Treatment with systemic immuno-stimulatory agents within 4 weeks or five half-lives of the drug (whichever is shorter) prior to the first dose of study treatment\n* Treatment with systemic corticosteroids or other systemic immunosuppressive medications within 2 weeks prior to the first dose of study treatment, or, anticipated requirement for systemic immunosuppressive medications during the trial\n* History of allergic reactions attributed to components of the formulated product(s)\n* Unwillingness or inability to comply with procedures required in this protocol",
