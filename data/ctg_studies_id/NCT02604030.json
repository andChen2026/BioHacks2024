    "eligibilityCriteria": "Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Twenty five women with breast cancer diagnosis, more than 18 years and able to raise the arms after head level will be recruited.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* History of musculoskeletal disorders of upper limbs;\n* Recurrence of Breast Cancer;\n* Bilateral breast cancer;\n* Presence of lymphedema;\n* Metastasis diagnosis;\n* Attendance impact on shoulder, identified by positive tests: Hawkins - Kennedy; or shoulder injury prior to surgery, with signs and symptoms compatible with subacromial pain syndrome;\n* Previous history of surgery and fractures in upper limb;\n* Allergy to tape transpore, necessary to display the sensors during scapular kinematics assessment;\n* Body mass index (BMI ) greater que 28 kg/m\u00b2, as can compromising data quality due to increased of subcutaneous tissue amount. This has been linked to an increase in the artifact in electromagnetic kinematic analysis signal.",
