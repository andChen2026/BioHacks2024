    "eligibilityCriteria": "Inclusion Criteria:\n\n1. Patients must have histologically confirmed glioblastoma multiforme, triple-negative breast cancer, colorectal cancer, or non-small cell lung cancer patients with advanced disease and limited therapeutic options.\n2. Patients must have measurable disease, defined as at least one lesion that can be accurately measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter to be recorded for non-nodal lesions and short axis for nodal lesions) as \u226520 mm with conventional techniques or as \u226510 mm with spiral CT scan, MRI, or calipers by clinical exam. For lymph nodes to be considered measurable, the short axis must be \u226515 mm when assessed by CT scan. All other lesions (or sites of disease), including small lesions (longest diameter \\<10 mm or pathological lymph nodes with \u226510 to \\<15 mm short axis), are considered non-measurable disease. Bone lesions, leptomeningeal disease, ascites, pleural/pericardial effusions, lymphangitis cutis/pulmonitis, inflammatory breast disease, and abdominal masses (not followed by CT or MRI), are considered non-measurable. See Section 11 for the evaluation of measurable disease.\n3. Patients are eligible for enrollment if they have not had prior chemotherapy, radiotherapy, anticancer therapy, or investigational agent within 28 days prior to the first dose (Week 1, Day 1); 42 days weeks in the case of alkylating agents. Patients are eligible for enrollment if they have had no surgery within 6 weeks prior to the first dose. Any number of prior therapies is allowable.\n4. All adverse events Grade \\> 1 related to prior therapies (chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and/or surgery) must be resolved, except for alopecia.\n5. Age \u226518 years.\n6. ECOG performance status \u2264 2 (Karnofsky \u2265 60%, see Appendix A).\n7. Life expectancy of greater than 10 weeks.\n8. Patients must have normal organ and marrow function as defined below:\n\n   * leukocytes \u2265 3,000/mcL\n   * absolute neutrophil count \u2265 1,500/mcL\n   * platelets \u2265 100,000/mcL\n   * hemoglobin \\> 8.0 mg/dL\n   * total bilirubin \\< 2.0 x upper limit of normal\n   * AST (SGOT)/ALT (SGPT) \u22642.5 \u00d7 upper limit of normal creatinine OR creatinine clearance \u226560 mL/min/1.73 m2 for patients with creatinine levels above normal.\n9. The effects of ONC201 on the developing human fetus are unknown. For this reason, women of childbearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry and for the duration of study participation. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while she or her partner is participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately.\n10. Tumor specimen (paraffin-embedded block or frozen tissue) from prior resection or biopsy available that is sufficient to perform pharmacodynamic assays (\\>3 slides for IHC)\n11. Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n1. Patients who have received bevacizumab therapy.\n2. Patients with known brain metastases will be excluded from the phase I portion of the study. In the phase II portion, patients with known CNS metastases will be limited to 20% of the patient population to accrue proportionately. Patients with CNS metastases must be stable after therapy for CNS metastases (such as surgery, radiotherapy or stereotactic radiosurgery) for \\> 3 month and must be off steroid treatment prior to study enrollment and must have a life expectancy of 3 months or greater to be eligible.\n3. History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic composition to ONC201 or its excipients.\n4. Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active infection or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements\n5. Pregnant women are excluded from this study because ONC201 is novel agent with unknown potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with ONC201, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated with ONC201.\n6. Patients with a known HIV-positive test on combination antiretroviral therapy are ineligible for the initial first-in-man trial because of the potential for pharmacokinetic interactions with ONC201. In addition, these patients are at increased risk of lethal infections when treated with marrow-suppressive therapy. Appropriate studies will be undertaken in patients receiving combination antiretroviral therapy when indicated.\n7. Patients with known history of cardiac arrhythmias including atrial fibrillation, tachyarrhythmias or bradycardia will be excluded. Patients receiving therapeutic agents known to prolong QT interval will be excluded. Patients with history of CHF, or MI or stroke in the last 3 months will be excluded. Patients with a history of seizures will be excluded form the initial trial because ONC201 crosses the blood-brain barrier and this may affect their anti-seizure therapy.\n8. Active drug use or alcoholism.",
