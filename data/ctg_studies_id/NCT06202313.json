Having good organ function:\n\n   1. Blood routine examination (no blood components or cell growth factors were used to support treatment within the first 2 weeks of randomization):\n\n      Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) \u2265 1.5 \u00d7 10\\^9/L;\n\n      \u00b7 Platelet count \u2265 100 \u00d7 10\\^9/L; Hemoglobin \u2265 9.0g/dL.\n   2. Kidney:\n\n      Creatinine \\< 1.5 \u00d7 ULN, or creatinine clearance rate \\* (CrCl) calculated value \u2265 50mL/min;\n\n      \\*The Cockcroft Fault formula will be used to calculate CrCl: CrCL (mL/min)={(140 age) \u00d7 Body weight (kg) \u00d7 F} /(SCr (mg/dL) \u00d7 72) Among them: F=1 for males and F=0.85 for females; SCr=serum creatinine.

Female subjects with fertility must undergo a serum pregnancy test within 72 hours before the first medication, and the result should be negative. If a female subject with fertility engages in sexual activity with an unsterilized male partner, the subject must adopt an acceptable contraceptive method starting from screening and must agree to continue using the contraceptive method for 120 days after the last dose of the study drug; Periodic abstinence and safe period contraception are unacceptable contraceptive methods. Whether to stop contraception after this time point should be discussed with researchers.\n\n    1. Women with fertility refer to those who have not undergone surgical sterilization (i.e. bilateral fallopian tube ligation, bilateral oophorectomy, or total hysterectomy) or those who have not undergone menopause (defined as those who have ceased menstruation for at least 12 consecutive months without alternative medical reasons, and whose serum follicle stimulating hormone levels are within the laboratory reference range of postmenopausal women);\n    2. An efficient contraceptive method refers to a contraceptive method with a low failure rate (such as less than 1% per year) under continuous and correct use. Not all contraceptive methods are efficient. In addition to barrier contraception, female subjects with fertility can also use hormonal contraception (such as birth control pills), intrauterine device contraception, etc. to ensure that pregnancy does not occur.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n1. human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) is positive and/or hormone receptor is positive.\n2. Previously received treatment with PD-1 monoclonal antibody, PD-L1 monoclonal antibody, or CTLA-4 monoclonal antibody.\n3.

Currently participating in another clinical study, unless it is an observational, non-interventional clinical study, or a follow-up period of an intervention study.\n5. Have active or untreated brain metastases, meningeal metastases, spinal cord compression, or leptomeningeal diseases. However, participants who meet the following requirements and have measurable lesions outside the central nervous system are allowed to be enrolled: asymptomatic after treatment, imageologically stable for at least 4 weeks before the start of study treatment (if there are no new or expanded brain metastases), and have stopped systemic glucocorticoid and anticonvulsant drug treatment for at least 2 weeks.\n6. Have clinical symptoms of pleural effusion, pericardial effusion, or pleural/ascites that require frequent drainage (\u2265 once per month).\n7.

Except for the following:\n\n   1. Skin diseases that do not require systematic treatment (such as vitiligo, alopecia, psoriasis, or eczema);\n   2. Hypothyroidism caused by autoimmune thyroiditis requires only stable doses of hormone replacement therapy;\n   3. Type I diabetes requiring only a stable dose of insulin replacement therapy;\n   4. Childhood asthma has completely relieved, and no intervention is required in adulthood;\n   5. Researchers have determined that the disease will not recur without external triggering factors.\n8.

Toxicity that has not been alleviated by previous anti-tumor therapy is defined as failure to regress to the National Cancer Institute Adverse Event General Terminology Standard (NCICTCAE v5.0) level 0 or 1, or the level specified in the inclusion/exclusion criteria, except for hair loss/pigmentation. Subjects who have experienced \u2265 3 levels of immune related toxicity during previous treatment with immune checkpoint inhibitors are not allowed to be enrolled.\n\n   For subjects who experience irreversible toxicity and are expected to not worsen after administration of the study drug (such as hearing loss), they may be included in the study after consultation with the medical supervisor. It is known that there are active or untreated brain metastases, meningeal metastases, spinal cord compression, or leptomeningeal diseases. However, participants who meet the following requirements and have measurable lesions outside the central nervous system are allowed to be enrolled: asymptomatic after treatment, imageologically stable for at least 4 weeks before the start of study treatment (if there are no new or expanded brain metastases), and have stopped systemic glucocorticoid and anticonvulsant drug treatment for at least 2 weeks. Subjects with long-term toxicity that cannot be restored according to the judgment of the researchers may be included in the study after consultation with medical inspectors.\n10.

The presence of interstitial lung disease or non infectious pneumonia is known, and the disease is currently symptomatic or requires systemic glucocorticoid treatment in the past. Researchers have determined that it may affect the toxicity assessment or management related to the study treatment.\n12. Active pulmonary tuberculosis is known to exist. Subjects suspected of active pulmonary tuberculosis need to undergo chest X-ray examination, sputum examination, and elimination through clinical symptoms and signs.\n13.
