If the patient is receiving ongoing corticosteroid therapy, the following criteria must be met:\n* The patient must be receiving a stable or decreasing dose \u2264 dexamethasone 4 mg/day or equivalent anti-inflammatory potency of another corticosteroid\n* The dose of corticosteroid may not have been escalated for at least 14 days before the start of study treatment\n* Patient is currently receiving increasing or chronic treatment with corticosteroids (\\>dexamethasone 4 mg or equivalent anti-inflammatory potency of another corticosteroid) or another immunosuppressive agent.\n* Note: Topical applications (e.g., rash), inhaled sprays (e.g., obstructive airways diseases), eye drops or local injections (e.g., intra-articular) are allowed. Patients with previously treated and asymptomatic brain metastases, are permitted to use corticosteroids as per specific protocol criteria\n* Patient is currently receiving treatment with drugs known to be moderate or strong inhibitors or inducers of isoenzyme CYP3A. The patient must have discontinued strong inducers for at least one week and must have discontinued strong inhibitors before the treatment is initiated. Switching to a different medication prior to starting study treatment is allowed.\n\n  * Other protocol-defined inclusion/exclusion criteria may apply.",
