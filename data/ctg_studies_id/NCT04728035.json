Those who have contraindications or intolerance to a certain drug above should receive at least one cycle of treatment with this drug, and can be exempted from the requirements for the use of this drug.\n\nAdditional criteria for cohort 2 in dose expansion\n\n1.HER2 negative breast cancer defined as 0 - 1+ by immunohistochemistry or FISH negative result.\n\n2.Evidence of new and/or progressive brain metastases following previous radiotherapy (WBRT and/or SRS and/or gamma knife) and/or surgery.\n\n3.At least one measurable brain lesion (\u226510 mm on T1-weighted, gadolinium-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging).\n\nExclusion Criteria\n\n1.
