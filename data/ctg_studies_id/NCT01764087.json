At least one measurable lesions with the length of the longest diameter of \u2265 10 mm on spiral CT or multidetector CT or \u2265 20 mm on conventional CT\n7. Subjects who voluntarily consent to participate in this study and sign the written informed consent form\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n1. Uncontrolled central nervous system metastasis\n2. Malignant ascites requiring surgical treatment\n3. Subjects who have blood malignancies including leukemia; or who have received or will receive bone marrow transplantation\n4. Severe concurrent diseases as follows,\n\n   \u2460 History of unstable angina, heart failure, atrial or ventricular arrhythmia requiring pharmacological treatment, or having received treatment for myocardial infarction within 6 months (however, may be included under the judgment of the investigator if medically controlled), heart failure of Class III or IV by New York Heart Association Classes, or left ventricular ejection fraction of \\< 40%\n\n   \u2461 Receiving therapeutic dose administration of coumarin-type anticoagulants (however, up to 2 mg daily is permitted for line opening)\n\n   \u2462 Uncontrolled diabetes (fasting plasma glucose \\> 2.0 X UNL), severe hypertension, thyroid disorder and active infectious disease\n\n   \u2463 Psychiatric or neurological history including dementia or epilepsy which may threaten the compliance with this protocol\n\n   \u2464 A condition not allowing oral application of tablet formulation, and any clinically significant gastrointestinal abnormalities which may interfere with taking, passing or absorption of the study drug\n5.

Pregnant or breast-feeding women (however, women with 12 months of natural (spontaneous) amenorrhea or surgical bilateral oophorectomy (alone or with hysterectomy) at least 6 weeks ago, with appropriate clinical profile (e.g., appropriate age, history of vasomotor symptoms), will be considered women postmenopausal and of non-childbearing potential. In the case of oophorectomy alone, a woman will be considered to be of non-childbearing potential only if her reproductive condition is confirmed by follow-up hormone level assessment)\n8.
