    "eligibilityCriteria": "Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Have known tumor HER-2/neu expression; if determination is \"intermediate\" by immunohistochemistry, fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) must be performed; protocol therapy is determined by HER-2/neu result\n* Have histologically confirmed, operable breast cancer that is either:\n* Hormone receptor (estrogen receptor \\[ER\\] or progesterone receptor \\[PR\\]) positive and HER2/neu positive or\n* ER/PR negative\n* Have radiographically measurable breast cancer \\> 1cm (Operable lesions are T1c-T3 and N0-N2a; histologic confirmation should be by core needle biopsy only)\n* Be chemotherapy na\u00efve\n* Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of =\\< 2\n* Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) \\>= 1,500\n* Platelet count \\>= 100,000\n* Serum creatinine =\\< 1.5 x international upper limit of normal (IULN)\n* Bilirubin \\< 2.0\n* Serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase (SGOT)/serum glutamic pyruvate transaminase (SGPT) =\\< 2 x IULN\n* Alkaline phosphatase =\\< 2 x IULN\n* Have staging studies and tumor assessment prior to registration; staging studies include physical exam with bidimensional tumor measurements and mammography, ultrasound, or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to assess tumor volume; sentinel lymph node dissection or axillary needle biopsy must be completed prior to enrollment; MRI and positron emission tomography (PET) (fluorodeoxyglucose \\[FDG\\], methoxyisobutylisonitrile \\[MIBI\\] and fluoroestradiol \\[FES\\]) imaging will be done before enrollment if clinically indicated to assess tumor volume or may be done within the first month of study participation on another institutional protocol\n* Patients with clinically apparent cardiac disease, or history of same, are not eligible; patients who are \\>= 60 years of age or who have a history of hypertension must have an echocardiogram or multi gated acquisition scan (MUGA) prior to enrollment; patients with breast cancer that is HER-2/neu positive who will receive herceptin (trastuzumab) must have an echocardiogram or MUGA scan; the left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) must be within the institutional normal range; if LVEF is \\> 75%, the investigator should consider having the LVEF reviewed or repeating the MUGA prior to registration\n* Women of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test within seven days prior to registration\n* Be informed of the investigational nature of this study and provide written informed consent in accordance with institutional and federal guidelines prior to study specific screening procedures\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Primary tumor =\\< 1 cm, not measurable; inflammatory disease\n* Pregnant or lactating; woman of childbearing potential with either a positive or no pregnancy test at baseline are excluded; postmenopausal woman must have been amenorrheic for at least 12 months to be considered of non-childbearing potential; patients must agree to continue contraception for 30 days from the date of the last study drug administration; woman of childbearing potential not using a reliable and appropriate contraceptive method are excluded\n* Evidence of distant metastatic disease\n* Prior chemotherapy or hormonal therapy for breast cancer\n* Except for the following no other malignancy is allowed: synchronous ipsilateral breast cancer of the same subtype (ER/PR, HER-2/neu), adequately treated basal cell or squamous cell skin cancer, in situ cervical cancer or other stage I or II cancer from which the patient has been disease free for at least 5 years\n* Prior unanticipated severe reaction to fluoropyrimidine therapy, or known sensitivity to 5-fluorouracil\n* Previous enrollment in an investigational drug study within the past four weeks\n* History of uncontrolled seizures, central nervous system disorders, or psychiatric disability judged by the investigator to be clinically significant, precluding informed consent, or interfering with compliance with oral drug intake\n* Patients with cardiac disease that would preclude the use of Adriamycin, Taxol or Herceptin are not eligible\n* Active cardiac disease:\n* Angina pectoris that requires the use of antianginal medication\n* Cardiac arrhythmia requiring medication\n* Severe conduction abnormality\n* Clinically significant valvular disease\n* Cardiomegaly on chest x-ray\n* Ventricular hypertrophy on electrocardiogram (EKG)\n* Uncontrolled hypertension, (diastolic greater than 100 mm/Hg or systolic \\> 200 mm/hg)\n* Current use of digitalis or beta blockers for congestive heart failure (CHF)\n* Clinically significant pericardial effusion\n* History of cardiac disease:\n* Myocardial infarction documented as a clinical diagnosis or by EKG or any other test\n* Documented congestive heart failure\n* Documented cardiomyopathy\n* Documented arrhythmia or cardiac valvular disease that requires medication or is medically significant\n* Major surgery within 4 weeks of the start of study treatment without complete recovery\n* Lack of physical integrity of the upper gastrointestinal tract or malabsorption syndrome\n* Known, existing uncontrolled coagulopathy\n* Unwillingness to give written informed consent\n* Unwillingness to participate or inability to comply with the protocol for the duration of the study",
