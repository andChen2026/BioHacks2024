Agrees to notify the investigator when deviating from the protocol requirements with regard to concomitant medications;\n15. Agrees to stay in contact with the study site for the duration of the study and to provide updated contact information as necessary, and has no current plans to move from the study area for the duration of the study.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n1. Participation in a study of an investigational agent or use of an investigational device at the time of screening or within 4 weeks of enrollment;\n2. Receipt of treatment with a monoclonal antibody (mAb) within 4 weeks of enrollment or not recovered from an adverse event (i.e., event is \\>Grade 1 or subject has not returned to baseline) due to treatment with a mAb administered \\>4 weeks before enrollment;\n3. Receipt of chemotherapy, targeted small molecule therapy, or radiation therapy within 2 weeks prior to enrollment, or not recovered from an adverse event (i.e., event is \\>Grade 1 or subject has not returned to baseline) due to a previously-administered agent;\n4. Major surgical procedure or significant traumatic injury within 4 weeks prior to screening;\n5. Diagnosis of an additional malignancy that is progressing and requires treatment; exceptions include basal cell carcinoma of the skin, squamous cell carcinoma of the skin, and in situ cervical cancer that has undergone potentially curative therapy;\n6.
