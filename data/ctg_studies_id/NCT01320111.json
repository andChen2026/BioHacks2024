Radiotherapy within 3 weeks of start of study drug, palliative radiotherapy will be allowed.\n3. Major surgery within 4 weeks of start of study\n4. Autologous bone marrow transplant or stem cell rescue within 4 months of study entry\n5. Use of biologic response modifiers, such as G-CSF, within 3 week of study entry. \\[G-CSF and other hematopoietic growth factors may be used in the management of acute toxicity such as febrile neutropenia when clinically indicated or at the discretion of the investigator; however they may not be substituted for a required dose reduction.\\] \\[Patients taking chronic erythropoietin are permitted provided no dose adjustment is undertaken within 2 months prior to the study or during the study\\]\n6.
