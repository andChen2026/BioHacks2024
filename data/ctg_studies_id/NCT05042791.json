Patients need to voluntarily join this study after they fully understand and sign the informed consent form. Patients need to have good compliance and be willing to cooperate with follow-up.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n1. Patients with brain metastases with extensive meningeal metastasis\n2. Brain metastases within 5 mm of the hippocampus\n3. There are many factors that affect the administration and absorption of drugs, for example: inability to swallow, chronic diarrhea and intestinal obstruction\n4. Those who have received chemotherapy, surgical treatment (excluding local puncture) or molecular targeted therapy within 4 weeks before enrollment; those who have received anti-tumor endocrine therapy after the screening period\n5. Participated in other drug clinical trials within 4 weeks before enrollment\n6. Have used or are currently using HER2 tyrosine kinase inhibitors (lapatinib, niratinib, pyrotinib, etc.)\n7.
