Women of childbearing potential must take the pregnancy test and must commit to receive Leuteinizing Hormone Realising Hormone (LHRH) agonist Zoladex (goserelin) for two years starting from the commencement of the study medications\n9. Required Initial Laboratory Data. Adequate hematologic, renal and hepatic function, as defined by each of the following:\n\n1. Granulocyte \u2265 1,500/\u03bcL 2.

Women of childbearing potential not using a reliable and appropriate contraceptive method. Postmenopausal women must have been amenorrheic for at least 12 months to be considered of non-childbearing potential.\n2. Patients with distant metastasis (brain and/or visceral metastasis)\n3.

Participation in any investigational drug study within 4 weeks preceding the start of study treatment\n6. Other serious uncontrolled medical conditions that the investigator feels might compromise study participation including but not limited to chronic or active infection, HIV-positive patient, uncontrolled hypertension, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, uncontrolled Diabetes mellitus, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements.",
