Lesions that have progressed after prior radiosurgery should not be selected as measurable disease if they are suspected of being radionecrosis.\n\nThe following measurement criteria are required, as visualized by contrast-enhanced MRI with slice thickness of \u2264 1.5 mm, unless absence of contrast or thicker slices is specifically authorized by Protocol Director. Measurements do not include tumor edema.\n\n* At least one CNS tumor measuring \u2265 10 mm in longest diameter, OR\n* At least one CNS tumor measuring 5-9 mm in longest diameter, plus one or two additional CNS tumors measuring \u2265 3 mm in longest diameter, for which the sum of the longest diameters is \u2265 10 mm. Additional tumors are not exclusionary.\n\nAdequate organ function as evidenced by:\n\n* Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) \u2265 1.5 x 10e9/L without G-CSF (filgrastim, pegfilgrastim, or equivalent) support within 7 days\n* Hemoglobin (Hgb) \u2265 9.0 g/dL (90 g/L) without blood transfusion within 7 days\n* Platelet count \u2265 100 x 10e9/L without platelet transfusion within 7 days\n* Bilirubin \u2264 1.5 X upper limit of normal (ULN), except for patients with documented history of Gilbert's disease who may have DIRECT bilirubin \u2264 1.5 X ULN\n* Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) \u2264 2.5 X ULN, except \u2264 5 X ULN for patients with liver metastases\n* Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) \u2264 2.5 X ULN, except \u2264 5 X ULN for patients with liver metastases\n* Serum creatinine \u2264 1.5 X ULN; or calculated creatinine clearance \u2265 50 mL/min (using Cockcroft-Gault formula), or measured creatinine clearance \u2265 50 mL/min.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Previous treatment with a camptothecin derivative (eg, irinotecan, topotecan, and investigational agents including but not limited to exatecan, rubitecan, gimatecan, karenitecin, SN38 investigational agents, EZN 2208, SN 2310, and AR 67) is not allowed\n* Patients may not have a known history of leptomeningeal disease, as diagnosed by positive CSF cytology, unless prospective permission for enrollment is granted from the sponsor and the PI\n* Patients may not have had major surgery or radiotherapy (therapeutic and/or palliative) within 14 days prior to initiation of study treatment, including CNS-directed radiation therapy. Minor procedures, such as tumor biopsy, thoracentesis, or intravenous catheter placement are allowed with no waiting period\n* Patients may not have the following co morbid disease or concurrent illness:\n\n  * Chronic or acute gastrointestinal (GI) disorders resulting in diarrhea of any severity grade; patients may not use chronic anti-diarrheal supportive care (more than 3 days/week) to control diarrhea in the 28 days prior to first dose of investigational drug. (exception: anti-diarrheal medications used to control symptoms from a medication that will be discontinued prior to study are allowed with a 7 day washout before study therapy, for example loperamide for erlotinib-associated diarrhea)\n  * Known cirrhosis, defined as Child Pugh class A or higher liver disease\n  * Other active malignancy, except for non melanoma skin cancer and carcinoma in situ (of the cervix or bladder)\n  * Any other severe/uncontrolled inter current illness or significant co morbid conditions that in the opinion of the investigator would impair study participation or cooperation\n* Patients may not have a known allergy or hypersensitivity to any of the components of the investigational therapy, including polyethylene glycol (PEG) or topoisomerase inhibitors\n* Patients may not be receiving the following medications at the time of first dose of investigational drug:\n\n  * Pharmacotherapy for known hepatitis B or C, tuberculosis, or human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)\n  * Any of the following enzyme inducing anti epileptic medications (EIAEDs): phenytoin, carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine, phenobarbital\n  * Other chemotherapy, hormonal therapy, immunotherapy, other investigational agents, or biologic agents for the treatment of cancer except for bisphosphonates or denosumab\n* Pregnant or nursing patients will be excluded from the study",
