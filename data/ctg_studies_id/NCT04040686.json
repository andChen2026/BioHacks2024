Abnormal liver function during baseline screening period : AST or ALT\\> 2 times the upper limit of normal value (ULN), if the marginal increase of a single index is judged as having no clinical significance by the investigator, it can be retested during the screening period. Once, if \u2264 2 times ULN after retesting, consider enrolling).\n7. Impaired renal function during screening: serum creatinine or urea nitrogen \\> 1.5 times ULN.\n8.
