    "eligibilityCriteria": "Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Patients with histologically confirmed breast cancer who are scheduled to receive standard of care neoadjuvant chemotherapy prior to surgical management\n* No contraindication for an MRI exam\n* Normal kidney functional for receiving a standard dose of gadolinium-based MRI contrast agent through IV injection\n* Not pregnant\n* Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document. A signed study-specific informed consent must be obtained prior to any study specific procedures\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Patients who would be normally excluded from undergoing an MRI examination - patients with a pacemaker, aneurysm clip, or any other condition that would warrant avoidance of a strong magnetic field\n* Patients who are unable to cooperate for an MRI exam lasting about 45 min, and/or have known allergic reaction to gadolinium-based contrast agent\n* Severe claustrophobia precluding subject from undergoing MRI\n* Patients with acute or chronic kidney dysfunction (estimated glomerular filtration rate \\[eGFR\\] \\< 60 ml/min/1.73 m\\^2 as calculated using the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease \\[MDRD\\] equation)\n* Pregnant participants are excluded from this study because it is difficult for them to lie prone on the MRI table and because of possible risk to the fetus",
