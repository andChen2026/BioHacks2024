Baseline measurements of the indicator lesions must be recorded on the Patient Registration Form. To be valid for baseline, the measurements must have been made within the 14 days if palpable. If not palpable, a mammogram or MRI must be done within 14 days. If palpable, a mammogram or MRI must be done within 2 months prior to study entry. If clinically indicated, xrays and scans must be done within 28 days of study entry.\n* Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 0 to 2.\n* No prior chemotherapy, hormonal therapy, biologic therapy or radiation therapy for breast cancer.\n* Adequate organ function within 14 days of study entry:\n\n  * Bone marrow function: absolute neutrophil count (ANC) \u2265 1500/mm\u00b3, Hgb \\> 8.0 g/dl, and platelet count \u2265 100,000/mm\u00b3.\n  * Hepatic function: total bilirubin \\< upper limit of normal (ULN). Serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase (SGOT)(AST) or serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase (SGPT)(ALT) and alkaline phosphatase \u2264 1.5 x ULN.\n  * Renal function: calculated creatinine clearance (CrCl) \u2265 30 mL/min using the Cockroft Gault equation.\n* Patients must be at least 18 years of age.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Pregnant or lactating women are not eligible. Women of childbearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test completed within 7 days of study entry, and use an appropriate form of birth control throughout the trial period.\n* No medical, psychological or surgical condition which the investigator feels might compromise study participation.\n* No patients with history within the last 5 years of previous or current malignancy at other sites with the exception of adequately treated carcinoma in-situ of the cervix or basal or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin. Patients with a history of other malignancies who remain disease free for greater than five years are eligible.\n* No evidence of peripheral or sensory neuropathy.\n* Patients with a history of severe hypersensitivity reaction to docetaxel or other drugs formulated with polysorbate 80 are excluded from participation.\n* No serious, uncontrolled, concurrent infection(s).\n* No clinically significant cardiac disease (e.g. congestive heart failure, symptomatic coronary artery disease and cardiac arrhythmias not well controlled with medication) or myocardial infarction within the last 12 months prior to study entry.\n* No major surgery within 28 days of study entry.\n* No evidence of central nervous system (CNS) metastases.",
