    "eligibilityCriteria": "Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* The patient must consent to be in the study and must have a signed an approved consent form conforming with institutional guidelines.\n* Patient must be \\> 50 years old.\n* The patient should have a life expectancy of at least two years with a karnofsky performance status \\> 70.\n* The patient must have stage 0 or I breast cancer.\n* On histological examination, the tumor must be DCIS or invasive adenocarcinoma of the breast.\n* Surgical treatment of the breast must have been lumpectomy. The margins of the resected specimen must be histologically free of tumor (\\>2mm, DCIS and invasive). Re-excision of surgical margins is permitted.\n* Gross disease must be unifocal with pathologic (invasive and/or DCIS) tumor size 2 cm or less. (Patients with microscopic multifocality are eligible as long as total pathologic tumor size is 2 cm or less.)\n* Patients with invasive breast cancer are required to have axillary staging which can include sentinel node biopsy alone (if negative), sentinel node biopsy followed by axillary dissection or sampling with a minimum total of 6 axillary nodes or axillary dissection alone (with a minimum of 6 axillary nodes). Axillary staging is NOT required for patients with DCIS.\n* The patient must have simulation within 8 weeks/56 days of the final surgery for their breast cancer (lumpectomy, re-excision of margins, or axillary staging procedure).\n* Patients with a history of non-ipsilateral breast malignancies are eligible if they have been disease-free for 2 or more years prior to enrollment. Patients with the following cancers are eligible even if diagnosed and treated within the past 2 years: carcinoma in situ of the cervix, colon, melanoma in situ, and basal cell and squamous cell carcinoma of the skin.\n* Chemotherapy is permitted if planned for \u2265 2 weeks after radiation.\n* Urine pregnancy test must be performed and be negative on all women younger than 60 who have not had a tubal ligation, oophorectomy, or hysterectomy.\n* Separate incisions for the lumpectomy and sentinel node biopsy should be present. Use of only one incision will typically result in a contiguous cavity with the tumor bed and the sentinel node sampling, and inability of the radiation oncologist to delineate the tumor bed from the sentinel node bed.\n* The patient must have a cavity which is able to be targeted with external beam APBI, either through surgical clip placement, or CVS 3 or higher. The cavity to whole breast ratio must be 30% or less.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Men are not eligible for this study as men are not breast conservation candidates.\n* T0, T2 (\\> 2.0 cm), T3, node positive, stage III or IV breast cancer.\n* Any positive axillary nodes.\n* Palpable or radiographically suspicious ipsilateral or contralateral axillary, supraclavicular, infraclavicular or internal mammary nodes, unless biopsy proven to be negative for tumor.\n* Suspicious microcalcifications, densities or palpable abnormalities in either breast unless biopsy proven to be benign.\n* Non-epithelial breast malignancies such as sarcoma or lymphoma.\n* Proven multicentric carcinoma in more than one quadrant or separated by more than 2 centimeters.\n* Paget's disease of the nipple.\n* History of invasive breast cancer or DCIS in the same breast.\n* Surgical margins that cannot be microscopically assessed or are less then 2 mm.\n* Collagen vascular disease, specifically dermatomyositis with a CPK level above normal or with an active skin rash, systemic lupus erythematosis or scleroderma.\n* Pregnancy or lactation at the time of proposed radiation. Women of reproductive potential must agree to use an effective non-hormonal method of contraception during therapy.\n* Psychiatric or addictive disorders or other conditions that, in the opinion of the treating physician, would preclude the patient from meeting the study requirements.\n* Patients with coexisting medical conditions in whom life expectancy is \\< 2 years.\n* Patients with skin involvement, regardless of tumor size.",
