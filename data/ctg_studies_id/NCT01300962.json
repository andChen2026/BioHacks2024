Double barrier contraceptives must be used throughout the trial by both sexes..\n* Women of child-bearing potential, defined as all women physiologically capable of becoming pregnant, must use highly effective contraception during the study. Women assigned to ARMS AC and D must use highly effective contraception for 16 weeks after stopping treatment. Women assigned to ARM A must continue contraceptive measures for 4 weeks after stopping treatment. Women assigned to ARM B must continue contraceptive measures for 5 weeks after stopping treatment. The highly effective contraception is defined as either:\n\n  * True abstinence: When this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the subject. Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, post-ovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception.\n  * Sterilization: have had surgical bilateral oophorectomy (with or without hysterectomy) or tubal ligation at least six weeks ago. In case of oophorectomy alone, only when the reproductive status of the woman has been confirmed by follow up hormone level assessment.\n  * Male partner sterilization (with the appropriate post-vasectomy documentation of the absence of sperm in the ejaculate). For female subjects on the study, the vasectomized male partner should be the sole partner for that patient.\n  * Use of a combination of any two of the following (a+b):\n\n    1. Placement of an intrauterine device (IUD) or intrauterine system (IUS)\n    2. Barrier methods of contraception: Condom or Occlusive cap (diaphragm or cervical/vault caps) with spermicidal foam/gel /film/cream/vaginal suppository\n* For ARMs A, C and D, oral contraception (OC), injected or implanted hormonal methods are not allowed as BKM120 and potentially decreases the effectiveness of hormonal contraceptives. For ARM B, oral contraceptives, injected or implanted hormonal methods are not allowed as the sole method of contraception, as BYL719 has not been characterized with respect to its potential to interfere with the PK and/or the effectiveness of OCs.\n\n  * Recovered from all reversible toxicities related to their previous treatment (other than alopecia) to \u2264grade 1 or baseline\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\nSubjects meeting any of the exclusion criteria listed below at baseline will be excluded from study participation:\n\n* Receiving concurrent endocrine, cytotoxic, or biologic agent(s) or within time limits specified above prior to study day 1\n* Receiving any other investigational agents currently, or within time limits specified above prior to study day 1\n* Received wide field radiotherapy \u22644 weeks, or SRS or gamma knife for brain metastasis \u2264 2 weeks or limited field radiation for palliation \u22642 weeks prior to starting either BYL719 or BKM120 or have not recovered from side effects of such therapy\n* Have undergone major surgery \u22642 weeks prior to starting BKM120 or BYL719 or have not recovered from side effects of such therapy\n* Prior treatment with treatment doses of capecitabine (prior radio-sensitizing doses of capecitabine are allowed as long as the patient did not progress on capecitabine)\n* Prior treatment with a PI3K inhibitor\n* Known dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD) deficiency\n* Treated with any hematopoietic colony-stimulating growth factors (e.g., G-CSF, GM-CSF) \u22642 weeks prior to starting study drug; erythropoietin or darbepoetin therapy, if initiated at least 2 weeks prior to enrollment, may be continued\n* Currently receiving treatment with medication known to prolong the QT interval or inducing Torsades de Pointes and the treatment cannot either be discontinued or switched to a different medication prior to starting study drug\n* Patients currently receiving chronic systemic treatment with steroids or another immunosuppressive agent; NOTE: This restriction regarding choice of glucocorticoid does not apply should patient need \\<2 week course of glucocorticoid for treatment of non-infectious pneumonitis during study, or if ARM C patient with brain metastases treated with glucocorticoid is enrolled.
