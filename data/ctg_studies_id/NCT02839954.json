Eligible diseases: MUC1+ malignant glioma of brain, colorectal carcinoma, gastric carcinoma, hepatocellular carcinoma, non-small cell lung cancer, pancreatic carcinoma and triple-negative basal-like breast carcinoma.\n2. Patients 18 years of age or older, and must have a life expectancy \\> 12 weeks.\n3. MUC1 is expressed in malignancy tissues by immuno-histochemical (IHC).\n4. Eastern cooperative oncology group (ECOG) performance status of 0-2 or karnofsky performance status (KPS) score is higher than 60.\n5. Presence of measurable disease by RECIST.\n6. Females of child-bearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test and all subjects must agree to use an effective method of contraception for up to two weeks after the last infusion of CAR-pNK cells.\n7.
