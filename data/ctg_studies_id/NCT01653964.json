    "eligibilityCriteria": "Inclusion Criteria:\n\nSubgroup 1, Patients with breast lesions:\n\n-At least one breast lesion detected by mammogram, ultrasound or breast MRI that measures \\< 20 mm in greatest dimension, presents as a mass, is considered suspicious or highly suggestive of malignancy according to the Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System Atlas criteria (BIRADS 4 or 5), and is scheduled for core-needle biopsy or surgical biopsy.\n\nOR\n\n-At least one breast lesion that measures between \\> 10 mm but \\< 20 mm in greatest dimension, presents as a mass, is biopsy-proven as malignant, and is scheduled for surgical resection.\n\nAND\n\n* Age \\> 40 years\n* Negative pregnancy test, postmenopausal, or surgically sterilized\n\nSubgroup 2, Patients without known breast lesions:\n\n* Negative screening mammogram performed at Mayo Clinic Rochester within 15 months prior to performance of study MBI\n* No signs or symptoms of breast disease\n* Age \\> 40 years\n* Negative pregnancy test, postmenopausal, or surgically sterilized\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Vacuum-assisted or excisional biopsy has been performed prior to the study MBI. Reason: these types of biopsies are more likely to remove all of the tumor\n* MBI is performed after biopsy and neo-adjuvant chemotherapy is planned prior to surgery. Reason: true tumor size will not be able to be ascertained from the final pathology findings\n* Breast implants. Reason: cases with breast implants will be easily identifiable on blinded interpretation to take place at the study end\n* Suspected that breasts will not fit in the MBI field of view. Reason: cases that require tiled views or additional views will be easily identifiable on blinded interpretation to take place at the study end\n* Only one breast remaining. Reason: unilateral cases will be easily identifiable on blinded interpretation to take place at the study end; injection timing is designed for bilateral views\n* Pregnancy test (if necessary) is not negative, or the patient is unable to complete the pregnancy test\n* Physically unable to sit upright and still remain still during two consecutive MBI studies over the course of a 2-hour period.",
