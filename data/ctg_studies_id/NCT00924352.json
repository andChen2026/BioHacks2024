Patient has(ECOG)performance status of \u2264 2.\n7. Patient must have received at least 1 but no more than 2 prior chemotherapy regimens for locally recurrent or metastatic disease. Patients may have received neoadjuvant and/or adjuvant chemotherapy. These prior regimens can not have included ixabepilone or dasatinib. A line of chemotherapy will be defined as one or more agents used continuously or discontinuously (i.e., allowing a break or chemo holiday) without the addition of a new agent. Hormonal therapy will not be considered a line of therapy.\n8. Prior chemotherapy must have been completed at least 3 weeks prior to study treatment start (6 weeks for nitrosoureas and mitomycin), and the patient must have recovered from all associated toxicities (except for alopecia and neuropathy grade 1 according to CTCAE, v3.0 classification).\n9. Radiation therapy, immunotherapy, biologic therapy, and hormonal/endocrine therapy must have been completed at least 2 weeks prior to study treatment start. Any major surgery must have been completed at least 4 weeks prior to study treatment start.\n10. Patient has adequate organ, metabolic and bone marrow function as follows:\n\n    1. Total bilirubin \u2264 1.0 \u00d7 institutional ULN\n    2. AST, ALT \u2264 2.5 \u00d7 institutional ULN\n    3. Serum sodium, potassium, calcium, magnesium, and phosphate \u2265 institutional LLN. (Hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia must be corrected prior to dasatinib administration.)\n    4. Serum creatinine \\< 1.5 \u00d7 institutional ULN\n    5. Hematologic function: - ANC \u2265 1500/mm3. -Platelet count \u2265 100,000/mm3. - Hemoglobin \u2265 10.0 g/dL\n    6. PT and PTT \\< 1.5 x institutional ULN\n11. Ability to take oral medication (dasatinib must be swallowed whole).\n12. Concomitant medications:\n\n    1. Patient agrees to discontinue St John's Wort at least 5 days prior to starting dasatinib therapy and while receiving dasatinib therapy.\n    2. Patient agrees that IV bisphosphonates will be withheld for the first 8 weeks of dasatinib therapy due to risk of hypocalcemia.\n    3. The use of CYP3A4 inducers, inhibitors, and substrates; medications that prolong QT interval; antacids; H2 blockers and proton pump inhibitors; and medications that inhibit platelet function and anticoagulation should be avoided during dasatinib therapy. These are restricted therapies that are permitted with caution when medically indicated.\n13. Women of childbearing potential must have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test prior to the start of study treatment.\n14. Patients of reproductive potential must agree to use and utilize an adequate method of contraception throughout treatment and for at least 4 weeks after study treatment is stopped.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\nA patient who meets any of the following criteria will be considered not eligible for inclusion in this study:\n\n1. Patient has had prior treatment with ixabepilone, dasatinib, or both.\n2. Patient has had more than 2 prior lines of chemotherapy for locally recurrent or metastatic breast cancer. A line of chemotherapy will be defined as one or more agents used continuously or discontinuously (i.e., allowing a break or chemo holiday) without the addition of a new agent. Hormonal therapy will not be considered a line of therapy.\n3. Patient has received a cumulative dose of \\> 360 mg/m2 of doxorubicin or \\> 600 mg/m2 of epirubicin.\n4. Prior radiation must not have included \u2265 30% of major bone marrow containing areas (pelvis, lumbar spine).\n5.

Patient has evidence CNS or brain metastases, unless CNS or brain metastases have been treated and stable for \\> 3 months.\n7. Patient has psychiatric illness or social situation that would limit or prohibit compliance with study requirements.\n8. Patient has an inability to take oral medication or inability to absorb oral medication.\n9. Patient has had any invasive cancer other than the one being treated in this study within 3 years with the exception of surgically cured nonmelanoma skin cancer; in situ carcinoma of the cervix; in situ carcinoma of the breast.\n10. Patient is receiving concurrent cancer therapy (chemotherapy, radiation therapy, immunotherapy, biologic therapy, or hormonal therapy for cancer).\n11. Patient has other serious medical conditions as judged by the Principal Investigator.\n12. Patient has a concurrent medical condition which may increase the risk of toxicity.\n13. Patient has a pleural or pericardial effusion of any grade.\n14. Patient has cardiac symptoms including any of the following:\n\n    1. Uncontrolled angina, congestive heart failure or myocardial infarction within 6 months of study entry.\n    2. Diagnosed congenital long QT syndrome.\n    3.
