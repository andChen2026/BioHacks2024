Advanced or metastatic breast cancer.\n2. Histological or cytological confirmation of ER+ status (defined as \\> 1% positive tumor cells), and histological or cytological confirmation of HER2-negative (HER2-) status by local laboratory testing using criteria in the American Society of Oncology (ASCO)/College of American Pathologists (CAP) Clinical Practice Guideline update.\n3.

Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) within 5 absolute percentage points of institutional standard of normal as measured by echocardiogram (ECHO) or multiple gated acquisition scan (MUGA) within 4 weeks before the first dose of MLN0128 (ie, if the institutional standard of normal is 50%, LVEF may be as low as 45% to be eligible for the study).\n8. Able to provide paraffin blocks or a minimum of 10 unstained slides of available archival tumor tissues (paraffin blocks are preferred). If archival tumor tissue is not available, a tumor biopsy may be performed before the patient begins treatment with MLN0128. If fewer than 10 slides are available or the tumor content/area requirements are not met, study eligibility will be determined upon discussion with the sponsor.\n9. Ability to swallow oral medications, willingness to perform mucositis prophylaxis, and suitable venous access for the study-required blood sampling.\n10. Voluntary written consent must be given before the performance of any study related procedure not part of standard medical care, with the understanding that consent may be withdrawn by the patient at any time without prejudice to future medical care.\n\n    Phase 1b Only: In addition to the previously mentioned inclusion criteria, each patient must meet the following inclusion criterion to be enrolled in the phase 1b portion of the study:\n11. Patients may have SD or disease progression during their most recent treatment with exemestane or fulvestrant, or everolimus in combination with either exemestane (any country) or fulvestrant (US only). Exemestane or fulvestrant in combination with MLN0128 can also be initiated as a new line of therapy.\n\n    Phase 2 Only: In addition to the previously mentioned inclusion criteria, each patient must meet all of the following inclusion criteria to be enrolled in the phase 2 portion of the study:\n12. Measurable disease defined as follows:\n\n    * At least 1 extra-osseous lesion that can be accurately measured in at least 1 dimension. The lesion must measure \u2265 20 mm with conventional imaging techniques or \u2265 10 mm with spiral computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), or\n    * Bone lesions (lytic or mixed \\[lytic plus sclerotic\\]) in the absence of measurable disease as defined above\n13. Patients must have had disease progression during treatment with everolimus in combination with either exemestane (any country) or fulvestrant (US only) (duration of treatment \u2265 4 weeks) and must have tolerated everolimus treatment in combination with exemestane (any country) or fulvestrant (US only) adequately according to the treating physician's judgment. Everolimus in combination with exemestane or fulvestrant is not required to be the most recent treatment before enrollment, but progression on the most recent anticancer therapy is required for enrollment.\n\nExclusion Criteria\n\nPatients meeting any of the following exclusion criteria are not to be enrolled in the study:\n\nPhase 1b and Phase 2\n\n1. Prior anticancer therapy or other investigational therapy within 2 weeks before administration of the first dose of MLN0128 (except for exemestane or fulvestrant, which should be continued).
