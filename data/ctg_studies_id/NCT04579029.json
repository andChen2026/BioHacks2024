Thus, the chances of all superficial lymphatics deteriorating to the extent that LVA surgery is not possible is extremely low - \\<1% we expect).\n  * Inability to give informed consent or cooperate with assessment procedures and follow-up because of cognitive or physical impairments\n  * Medical co-morbidities increasing the risk of general anaesthetic (significant cardiac / respiratory disease)\n  * Recurrent, metastatic or progressive disease, defined by oncology team on basis of clinical assessment or imaging\n  * Evidence of pre-existing / primary lymphoedema on clinical history or lymphoscintigraphy",
