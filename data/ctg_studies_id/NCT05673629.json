Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) on cardiac ultrasound \u226555%.\n8. ECOG performance status 0 or 1.\n9. Females of childbearing potential must agree to use effective contraception during the study and within 6 months after the last dose. The blood or urine pregnancy test for female patients of childbearing age prior to enrollment must be negative.\n10. The patient willingly participates in this study, will sign the informed consent form, and commits to following the treatment and follow-up schedule.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n1. Stage IV metastatic breast cancer.\n2. Inflammatory breast cancer.\n3. Bilateral primary breast cancer (including invasive cancer and carcinoma in situ).\n4. Patients who have previously received anti-tumor treatment or radiotherapy for any malignancy, excluding cured cervical carcinoma in situ, basal cell carcinoma of the skin and squamous cell carcinoma.\n5. Patients who receive any sex hormone therapy (e.g., birth control pills, hormone replacement therapy, etc.), or any hormonal drug (e.g., raloxifene, tamoxifen, or other selective estrogen receptor modulators) for osteoporosis or breast cancer prevention.\n6. Patients received major surgical operation unrelated to breast cancer within 4 weeks prior to randomization or having not yet fully recovered.\n7. Patients with symptomatic peripheral neuropathy with CTCAE 5.0 grade \u2265 2.\n8.

Patients unsuitable for corticosteroids.\n11. Patients with active infection and currently in need of systemic anti-infective therapy.\n12. Patients with history of immunodeficiency, including history of HIV, or other acquired or congenital immunodeficiency disease, or a history of organ transplantation.\n13. Patients who have participated in another interventional drug trial within 28 days prior to randomization or are concurrently participating in another clinical trial or using another investigational treatment.\n14. Patients during pregnancy (positive pregnancy test), lactation.\n15. Patients with any other co-morbidities that interfere with the regimens in this study, or in the opinion of the investigator, the subject has a history of other serious systemic disease or other reasons that make participation in this trial inadvisable.",
