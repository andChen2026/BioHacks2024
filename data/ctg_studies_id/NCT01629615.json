Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction (LVEF) \\< 50% as determined by Multiple Gated acquisition (MUGA) scan or echocardiogram (ECHO)Note: ECHO/MUGA is only required at baseline if patient has a history of abnormal cardiac test results\n  2. QTc \\> 480 msec on screening ECG (using the QTcF formula\n  3. Angina pectoris that requires the use of anti-anginal medication\n  4. Ventricular arrhythmias except for benign premature ventricular contractions\n  5. Supraventricular and nodal arrhythmias requiring a pacemaker or not controlled with medication\n  6.

Note: Topical applications (e.g., rash), inhaled sprays (e.g., obstructive airways diseases), eye drops or local injections (e.g., intra-articular) are allowed. Patients with previously treated brain metastases, who are on a stable low dose corticosteroids treatment (e.g., dexamethasone 2 mg/day, prednisone 10 mg/day) for at least 14 days before start of study treatment, are eligible\n* Other concurrent severe and/or uncontrolled medical condition that would, in the investigator's judgment contraindicate her participation in the clinical study (e.g., chronic pancreatitis, active chronic hepatitis etc.)\n* History of non-compliance to medical regimen\n* Current treatment with drugs known to be moderate and strong inhibitors or inducers of isoenzyme CYP3A, and the treatment cannot be discontinued or switched to a different medication prior to starting study drug\n* Known history of HIV (testing not mandatory) infection\n* Pregnant or nursing (lactating) woman\n* Woman of child-bearing potential unwilling to observe total sexual abstinence or to use a double barrier method for birth control throughout the trial.
