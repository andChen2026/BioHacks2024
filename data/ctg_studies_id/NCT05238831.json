    "eligibilityCriteria": "Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* PRE-SCREENING: Written informed consent prior to any pre-screening activities, study-specific procedures or interventions.\n* PRE-SCREENING: At least 18 years of age at time of informed consent. Persons of all gender identities, biological sexes, races, and ethnicities will be included.\n* PRE-SCREENING: A diagnosis of advanced sarcoma or advanced prostate, breast, ovarian, or pancreatic cancer. Change in an individual's cancer can be tracked objectively according to the Prostate Cancer Working Group 3 (PCWG3) criteria for prostate cancer, and Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.1 (RECIST v1.1) criteria for sarcomas and breast, ovarian, and pancreatic cancers.\n* PRE-SCREENING: Biospecimen collection, as per institutional standards, must be consented to and collection must be feasible, with the following exceptions for tissue collections:\n\n  * Individuals with a prior successful SMMART-CAP tumor tissue sample collected within the last 90 days may be eligible, given that =\\<1 treatment has been received within =\\< 90 days of that biopsy.\n* PRE-SCREENING: Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of =\\< 2.\n* PRE-SCREENING: Physician assessed life expectancy of \\>= 6 months.\n* PRIMARY TREATMENT: Documented progression after at least 1 line of prior therapy for advanced disease.

(assessed at primary \\[post pre-screening\\] screening, or by the time that study intervention commences)\n\n  * Creatinine clearance should be calculated per institutional standard. For participants with a baseline calculated creatinine clearance below normal institutional laboratory values, a measured baseline creatinine clearance should be determined. Individuals with higher values felt to be consistent with inborn errors of metabolism will be considered on a case-by-case basis.\n* PRIMARY TREATMENT: Total bilirubin =\\< 1.5 x IULN OR direct bilirubin IULN for individuals with total bilirubin levels \\> 1.5 x IULN. (assessed at primary \\[post pre-screening\\] screening, or by the time that study intervention commences)\n* PRIMARY TREATMENT: Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (serum glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase \\[SGOT\\]) / alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (serum glutamate pyruvate transaminase \\[SGPT\\]) =\\< 3 x IULN. (assessed at primary \\[post pre-screening\\] screening, or by the time that study intervention commences)\n* PRIMARY TREATMENT: International normalized ratio (INR) or prothrombin time (PT) =\\< 1.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN) unless individual is receiving anticoagulant therapy as long as PT or partial thromboplastin time (PTT) is within intended therapeutic range of intended anticoagulant therapy. (assessed at primary \\[post pre-screening\\] screening, or by the time that study intervention commences)\n* PRIMARY TREATMENT: Activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) or PTT =\\< 1.5 x ULN unless participant is receiving anticoagulant therapy, as long as PT or PTT is within therapeutic range of intended anticoagulant therapy. (assessed at primary \\[post pre-screening\\] screening, or by the time that study intervention commences)\n* PRIMARY TREATMENT: Body mass index (BMI) \\>16.0 and \\< 35.0 kg/m\\^2\n\n  * Participants with a BMI of \\>= 30.0 will use ideal body weight indices in calculating the delivery of agents that are dosed based upon body surface area (i.e., mg agent/meter squared) or weight (i.e., mg agent/kg body weight)\n* PRIMARY TREATMENT: Toxicities due to prior therapies should be resolved to baseline or grade 1 (per Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events \\[CTCAE\\] v5.0) before administration of study intervention. The following exceptions are permitted:\n\n  * Alopecia, fatigue, and lymphopenia due to prior therapies.\n  * Toxicities attributed to prior anti-cancer therapy that are not expected to resolve and to result in long lasting sequelae, (e.g., neuropathy after platinum-based therapy), may be permitted.\n* PRIMARY TREATMENT: Palliative radiation therapy completed \\>= two weeks prior to start of SMMART-ACT treatment to a measurable disease lesion (s).\n* PRIMARY TREATMENT: Additional eligibility criteria for the intended recommended therapy must also be met.\n* PRIMARY TREATMENT: Study intervention-specific eligibility criteria for the intended, recommended therapy must also be met.\n* CANCER SPECIFIC BREAST CANCER: Lesion(s) remain measurable after systemic therapies, as follows:\n\n  * At least one prior line of pharmacological therapy for hormone receptor (HR) positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative disease.\n  * At least one prior line of targeted therapy for HER2-postive disease.\n  * At least one prior line of combination therapy for triple negative disease lacking a BRCA1/2 mutation.\n  * At least one prior line of therapy with a PARP inhibitor for triple negative disease with a BRCA1/2 mutation.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* PRE-SCREENING: Evidence of active malignancy of another cancer with a natural or treatment history that may affect safety or efficacy assessments of this study or impose unacceptable risk to the participant. Guiding examples for those who can be enrolled include: individuals who have been disease free for two years; cancers with high cure rates (e.g., prior history of stage 1 rectal cancer and currently otherwise disease free); adequately treated localized non-melanomatous skin cancer.\n* PRE-SCREENING: Involuntarily incarceration, including, but not limited to, imprisonment and compulsory detained for treatment of psychiatric or physical (e.g., infectious disease) illness.\n* PRIMARY TREATMENT: Any brain/central nervous system (CNS) metastases or brain/CNS metastases that has progressed (e.g., evidence of new or enlarging brain metastasis that progresses within =\\< four weeks of CNS directed treatment as ascertained by clinical examination(s) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or computed tomography (CT) during the main eligibility screening period.\n* PRIMARY TREATMENT: One or more new, active brain/CNS metastasis or the presence of known leptomeningeal disease (LMD) that requires immediate treatment. If treatment within the first cycle of therapy is unlikely to be required, enrollment may be considered, as per the investigator.\n* PRIMARY TREATMENT: Concurrent forms of anti-cancer therapy that have the potential to interfere with efficacy and safety assessments or may that may pose increased risk to the participant while on a SMMART-ACT treatment, and as per the investigator. (Select hormone therapies, are allowed.)\n* PRIMARY TREATMENT: Untreated and/or uncured hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, as evidenced by detectable hepatitis B virus (HBC) ribonucleic acid (RNA) by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Prior treatment, concurrent treatment, and natural resolution of HCV infection are not exclusionary given (1) no risk for hepatic decompensation and (2) the intended SMMART ACT treatment is not expected to exacerbate HCV infection.\n* PRIMARY TREATMENT: Uncontrolled intercurrent illness and infection that may interfere with planned treatment including, but not limited to the following:\n\n  * Symptomatic congestive heart failure (New York Heart Association \\[NYHA\\] class III or IV)\n  * Unstable angina pectoris or coronary angioplasty, or stenting within \\< six months prior to enrollment,\n  * Cardiac arrhythmia (ongoing cardiac dysrhythmias of grade \\>=2 \\[National Cancer Institute (NCI) CTCAE v5.0\\]),\n  * Conditions that require intra-cardiac defibrillators,\n  * Known cardiac metastases,\n  * History of abnormal cardiac valve morphology (\\>= grade 2),\n  * Chronic graft versus host disease (GVHD) or immunosuppressive therapy for the control of GVHD.\n* PRIMARY TREATMENT: Severe infection within \\< four weeks prior to initiation of study treatment, including, but not limited to, hospitalization for complications of infection, bacteremia, or severe pneumonia.\n* PRIMARY TREATMENT: Inability or unwillingness to take oral medication (only for assigned oral study interventions).\n* PRIMARY TREATMENT: History of allergy to an assigned study agent or its excipients.\n* PRIMARY TREATMENT: Current pregnancy, currently breast-feeding, or unwillingness to not breastfeed while receiving study drug(s) or for the minimum required time after the last dose of study drug(s) as specified by the SMMART-ACT drug agents.\n* PRIMARY TREATMENT: Any condition that, in the opinion of the investigator, could jeopardize the participant's safety or adherence to the study protocol.",
