At the discretion of the Treating Physician, patients with 4+ nodes with other factors such as patient choice, older age, preexisting cardiac disease with normal MUGA or ECHO may be enrolled into a separate subgroup.\n* Has operable, histologically confirmed, invasive carcinoma of the breast.\n* Has known ER and PR status\n* Has adequate tumor specimen available for FISH analysis of TOP2A status (See Appendix VII)\n* Has had no prior chemotherapy unless it was given \\>5 years ago for breast cancer or other cancer\n* Has an ECOG Performance Status (PS) 0-1\n* Age \\>18 to \\<70 years old.\n* Has laboratory values of: See protocol for specific details\n* Has aspartate aminotransferase (AST) or alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) within the ranges shown below. In determining eligibility the more abnormal of the 2 values (AST or ALT) should be used.

An echocardiogram (ECHO). The same modality must be used throughout the study to evaluate LVEF. Ejection fraction (EF) as determined by ECHO must be WNL by institutional standard.\n* Has a negative serum pregnancy test within 7 calendar days prior to registration (female patients of childbearing potential \\[not surgically sterilized and between menarche and 1 year postmenopause\\]).\n* If fertile, patient has agreed to use an acceptable method of birth control (barrier contraceptive) to avoid pregnancy for the duration of the study and for a period of 3 months thereafter\n* Has signed a Patient Informed Consent Form\n* Has signed a Patient Authorization Form\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\nA woman will be excluded from this study if she meets any of the following criteria:\n\n* Has any evidence of disease following complete surgical resection of the primary tumor and metastatic workup\n* Has Stage IIIB breast cancer (T4 disease; ie, patients with fixed tumors, peau d'orange skin changes, skin ulcerations, or inflammatory changes).\n* Has Stage IV breast cancer (M1 disease on TNM staging system)\n* Had prior chemotherapy for breast cancer or other cancer within the last 5 years (no neoadjuvant chemotherapy in this study is permitted)\n* Has a history of severe hypersensitivity reaction to drugs formulated with polysorbate 80\n* Has had a myocardial infarction (MI) within 6 months of trial enrollment, or has New York Heart Association (NYHA) Class II or greater heart failure (see Appendix III), uncontrolled angina, severe uncontrolled ventricular arrhythmias, clinically significant pericardial disease, or electrocardiographic evidence of acute ischemic changes\n* Has abnormal baseline MUGA (or ECHO) (\\<50%, or less than institutional LLN)\n* Is receiving concurrent immunotherapy, hormonal therapy, or radiation therapy. Adjuvant hormonal therapy, if needed, may be given during radiation therapy and during treatment with trastuzumab after completion of chemotherapy.\n* Is receiving concurrent investigational therapy or has received such therapy within the past 30 calendar days\n* Has peripheral neuropathy \\>Grade 1\n* Has a serious uncontrolled intercurrent medical or psychiatric illness, including serious viral (including clinically defined AIDS), bacterial or fungal infection; or history of uncontrolled seizures, or diabetes, or CNS disorders deemed by the Treating Physician to be clinically significant, precluding informed consent\n* Has active hepatitis B or hepatitis C with abnormal liver function tests (LFTs) or is known to be HIV positive\n* Has a history of other malignancy within the last 5 years (except cured basal cell carcinoma of skin and carcinoma in situ of uterine cervix), which could affect the diagnosis or assessment of any of the study drugs\n* Is an obese patient to whom the Treating Physician would not be comfortable administering full doses of study drugs as calculated by the BSA. Obese patients will be treated based on actual body weight.
