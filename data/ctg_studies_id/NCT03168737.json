    "phase": "PHASE1",
    "allocation": "NON_RANDOMIZED",
    "primaryPurpose": "DIAGNOSTIC",
    "enrollmentCount": 25,
    "primaryOutcomeMeasure": "Relative change of imaging parameters (tumor volume, standardized uptake value [SUV], tumor to muscle ratio [TMR], hypoxic tumor volume [HTV1, HTV2], and total lesion hypoxia [TLH1, TLH2])",
    "eligibilityCriteria": "Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Patients with histopathologic diagnosis of a solid tumor. All solid tumors will be considered, but patients with breast, pancreas, and colorectal masses will be prioritized.\n* Patient must have a solid tumor with a short-axis greater than or equal to 1 cm (by CT, magnetic resonance imaging \\[MRI\\], ultrasonography or mammography) to allow reliable PET imaging.\n* A patient who has not received systemic or loco-regional treatment of the tumor within the last month.\n* Ability of the subject, or the legally authorized representative (LAR) if the patient is deemed by the treating physician to be cognitively impaired or questionably impaired in such a way that the ability of the patient to give informed consent is questionable, to understand, and the willingness to sign, a written informed consent.\n* Patients who are not expected to receive cancer therapy before imaging sessions are completed.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Pregnant or lactating women: pregnant women are excluded from this study because the effects of \\[18F\\] FAZA in pregnancy are not known. A urine or serum pregnancy test will be performed before accrual after informed consent is obtained.\n* Lactation should be suspended for at least two days following the administration of \\[18F\\] FAZA to the mother, because of the unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to administration of the radionuclide to a lactating woman.\n* Subjects with contraindications to the use of \\[18F\\] FAZA including confirmed allergy.\n* Patients with a body weight of 400 pounds or more, or a body mass index (BMI) which precludes their entry into the bore of the PET/CT scanner, because the findings will probably be compromised in image quality with CT, PET/CT and MRI.\n* Any additional medical condition, serious concurrent illness, or other extenuating circumstance that, in the opinion of the investigator may significantly interfere with study compliance.",
