    "eligibilityCriteria": "Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Diagnosis of intact primary (not recurrent) invasive carcinoma of the breast\n\n  * Stage IV disease\n  * Confirmation of the primary tumor should be by needle biopsy (preferred)\n  * Incisional surgical biopsy allowed as long as there is residual palpable or tumor image in the breast\n* Patients must be judged to be candidates for complete resection with free margins followed by radiation therapy (if radiation therapy is indicated)\n* For women not undergoing axillary dissection, sentinel node biopsy should document an axillary nodal burden of 1-2 involved lymph nodes (i.e., ACOSOG Z-11 criteria may be applied)\n* Prior non-invasive (Ductal Carcinoma In Situ) cancer allowed provided there has been no recurrence\n* Prior ipsilateral invasive cancer allowed if more than 5 years previous\n* Patients should have at least one organ system involved with distant metastatic disease\n\n  * If patient has only one metastatic lesion/focus, this must be proven by biopsy and the pathology report confirming the diagnosis of primary breast cancer, as well as the metastatic site, must be available\n* Must have available radiologic reports documenting disease status within the past 6 weeks prior to initiating systemic therapy\n* CNS metastases allowed provided projected survival \\> 6 months\n* Patients must have completed at least 16 weeks of optimal systemic therapy (appropriate to the tumor biological profile and the patient's age and menopausal status)\n\n  * If systemic therapy is discontinued for toxicity, but there is no distant progression and at least 12 weeks of therapy have been delivered, then the patient remains eligible\n  * Radiation therapy (if indicated) must begin within 12 weeks of final therapeutic surgical procedure (including re-excision for free margins and completion of axillary dissection)\n* Patients may register at any time from the time of diagnosis of stage IV breast cancer (if eligibility criteria met) to the time when a maximum of 30 weeks of induction systemic therapy has been completed\n\n  * Patients must be randomized within 16-32 weeks after the start of systemic therapy\n* Patients must not have experienced disease progression since the start of systemic therapy, as evidenced by radiographic documentation of disease status before treatment and within 4 weeks +/- 2 weeks prior to randomization, including:\n\n  * No new sites of disease\n  * No enlargement of existing sites by 20% or more in longest diameter\n  * No symptomatic deterioration\n* Patients who require radiotherapy to bone metastases during induction systemic therapy are eligible\n* Local disease at the primary site must be asymptomatic\n* Hormone receptor status known\n* Menopausal status not specified\n* Patients must have adequate organ function to undergo local therapy 4 weeks +/- 2 weeks prior to randomization per investigator discretion and institutional guidelines\n* More than 5 years since other primary cancers that were curatively treated\n* Negative pregnancy test\n* Fertile patients must use an accepted and effective contraception method\n\nExclusion criteria:\n\n* Synchronous contralateral breast cancer\n* Pregnant or nursing",
