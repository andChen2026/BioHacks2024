This timeframe allows ample time for any surgically related non lymphedema swelling to subside by 6 months post-surgery, while a cap of 5 years will capture the broadest range of cases, and has been used as a timeframe in several studies including our pilot study.\n* The affected arm must be \\>2cm larger than the unaffected arm. Differences of 2 cm or more between the affected and unaffected arm are considered by experts to be clinically significant. Each affected arm will be measured in two areas: upper arm and forearm.\n\nThe larger of the two measures-upper arm or forearm- will be used for analysis.\n\n* Classified as International Society of Lymphology (ISL) stage II or higher as determined by an MSKCC Certified Lymphedema Therapist (CLT).\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Bilateral lymphedema\n* Previous acupuncture treatment for lymphedema\n* Concurrent diuretic use\n* History of primary (congenital) lymphedema\n* Pregnant or planning to become pregnant during the course of the study\n* Has an implanted electronically charged medical device",
