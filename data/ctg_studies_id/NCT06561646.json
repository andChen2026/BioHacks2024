Patients with the diagnosed breast cancer confirmed by core needle biopsy and unilateral operation was performed; Breast cancer patients with tumor node metastasis stage 0-III according to the 8th edition of the American Joint Commission on Cancer; Preoperative clinical examination or imaging evaluation shows that the distance between the tumor and the Nipple Areolar Complex (NAC) is more than 1cm. The tumor has a diameter of 2-3 cm and can be located in any quadrant or reduced to 3 cm through preoperative neoadjuvant chemotherapy. The distance between the lesion and the skin should be at least 8-10 mm;\n3. There is no clinical or imaging evidence to prove that the tumor has invaded the skin, chest wall, or nipple areola complex;\n4. There are indications for breast preservation, but the patient has a strong desire for reconstruction and is unwilling to undergo breast preservation surgery;\n5. Preventive mastectomy (BRCA1/2 malignant mutation with obvious family history of breast cancer and other high-risk groups);\n6. Preoperative clinical manifestations and imaging data showed no distant metastasis;\n7. No history of breast cancer or other serious underlying diseases in the past;\n8. Karnofsky performance status score \u2265 70;\n9. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group score \u2264 2 ;\n10. The surgical procedure includes a single-port robot (intraperitoneal endoscopic surgical system) for total mastectomy with preservation of the nipple and areola, sentinel lymph node biopsy, axillary lymph node dissection, and stage I breast prosthesis implantation;\n11. Participants are able to understand the research process, voluntarily join the study, sign informed consent forms, have good compliance, and cooperate with follow-up;\n12. No swallowing difficulties; No shoulder joint movement disorders;\n13. Complete clinical data.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n1. Male breast cancer or inflammatory breast cancer;\n2. Metastatic breast cancer (stage IV); Tumor invasion of the skin, pectoralis major muscle, or NAC;\n3. The clinical data is basically incomplete;\n4. Previously received chemotherapy in an external hospital or has undergone tumor resection in an external hospital;\n5. Bilateral breast cancer surgery;\n6. Other surgical methods;\n7. Preoperative distant metastasis or supraclavicular lymph node dissection;\n8. Complicated with other malignant tumors or had malignant tumors other than breast cancer in recent 5 years;\n9. The serious disease of non malignant tumors combined will affect the patient's compliance or put the patient in a dangerous state;\n10. Dementia, intellectual disability, or any mental illness that hinders understanding of informed consent forms.",
