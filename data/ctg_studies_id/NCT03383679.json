    "eligibilityCriteria": "Inclusion Criteria:\n\n1. Woman, \u226518 years old;\n2. Histologically confirmed locally recurrent (unresectable) or metastatic breast cancer;\n3. Triple negative breast cancer:\n\n   Estrogen receptor (ER)-negative and Progesterone receptor (PgR)-negative, as defined by a \\<10 % tumor stained cells by immunohistochemistry (IHC); HER2 negative status (i.e. IHC score 0 or 1+, or IHC score 2+ and FISH/SISH/CISH negative), confirmed centrally before inclusion with FFPE tissue from the primary tumour;\n4. Androgen receptor (AR)-positive, as defined centrally by a \u2265 10% tumor stained cells by IHC Note: AR assessment by local pathologist before inclusion is not mandatory;\n5. Patients with a relapse or progressive disease should be chemotherapy na\u00efve or have received a maximum of one line of chemotherapy for advanced disease (providing they are not presenting with life-threatening metastasis); patients could have received adjuvant or neo-adjuvant therapy;\n6. In the exceptional situation of pre-menopausal patient, the addition of a LHRH analog is recommended (androgens might act as an estrogen antagonist in premenopausal patients);\n7. Presence of measurable or evaluable disease according to response evaluation criteria in solid tumors version 1.1 (RECIST v1.1)\n8. Eastern cooperative oncology group (ECOG) \u22641;\n9. Normal hematological function: Absolute neutrophile count (ANC) \u22651,500/mm\u00b3; platelets count \u2265100,000/mm\u00b3; hemoglobin \\>10 g/dL; Note: subject must not have received any growth factor within 4 weeks or blood transfusion within 7 days of the hematology laboratory sample obtained at screening)\n10. Normal hepatic function: total bilirubin \u2264 1.5 upper normal limit (UNL) unless this increase is due to a known Gilbert's disease; aspartate aminotransferase (ASAT) and alanine aminotransferase (ALAT) \u22642.5 UNL (or \u22645 UNL in case of hepatic metastasis);\n11. Creatinine clearance (MDRD formula) \u226550 mL/min;\n12. Systolic blood pressure (BP) \\<160 mm Hg and diastolic BP \\<95 mm Hg, as documented on day of registration/consent (Hypertension allowed provided it is currently controlled);\n13. Cardiac ejection fraction \u226550% measured by multigated acquisition (MUGA) or echocardiography (ECHO) done within 4 weeks before inclusion;\n14. For premenopausal patients, patient agreeing to use effective contraception during and for \u22656 months after completion of study treatment;\n15. Patient able to comply with the protocol;\n16. Patient must have signed a written informed consent form prior to any study specific procedures;\n17. Patient must be affiliated to a Social Health Insurance.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n1. HER2-positive status (positivity defined as IHC3+ and/or FISH amplification \u22652);\n2. Other concurrent malignancies, except adequately treated cone-biopsied in situ carcinoma of the cervix or basal cell or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin; patients who have undergone potentially curative therapy for a prior malignancy are eligible provided there is no evidence of disease for \u22655 years and patient is deemed to be at low risk for recurrence;\n3. Active brain metastases or leptomeningeal disease; history of brain metastases allowed provided lesions are stable for at least 3 months as documented by head CT scan or Magnetic resonance Imaging (MRI) of the brain;\n4. Non-malignant systemic disease, including active infection or concurrent serious illness that would make the patient a high medical risk;\n5. Significant cardiovascular disease, including any of the following:\n\n   1. NYHA class III-IV congestive heart failure\n   2. Stroke, unstable angina pectoris or myocardial infarction within the past 6 months\n   3. Severe valvular heart disease\n   4. Ventricular arrhythmia requiring treatment;\n6. Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, the Lapp lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not be included;\n7. Persistent toxicities grade \u22652 from any cause, except chemotherapy-induced alopecia and grade 2 peripheral neuropathy;\n8. Any gastrointestinal disorder interfering with absorption of the study drug;\n9. Difficulties with swallowing tablets;\n10. An active viral hepatitis, known human immunodeficiency virus infection with detectable viral load, or chronic liver disease requiring treatment;\n11. PREVIOUS TREATMENT IN THE METASTATIC SETTING: Previous treatment with: capecitabine (MET SETTING), first generation (bicalutamide) or second-generation AR inhibitors (enzalutamide, ARN-509, darolutamide) or other investigational AR inhibitors CYP17 enzyme inhibitor such as abiraterone (capecitabine in the adjuvant setting is allowed provided the last administration was at least \u226512 months prior to study entry)\n12. Patients with known deficit of dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD) activity; or in case of hypersensitivity to capecitabine or to any of its excipients or to fluorouracil;\n13. Prior anticancer therapy within the last 3 weeks including radiotherapy, endocrine therapy, immunotherapy; chemotherapy (6 weeks for nitrosoureas and mitomycin C), or other investigational agents; concurrent palliative radiotherapy is allowed;\n14. Concurrent enrolment in another clinical trial in which investigational therapies are administered;\n15. Pregnant women, women who are likely to become pregnant or are breast-feeding;\n16. Patients with any psychological, familial, sociological or geographical condition potentially hampering compliance with the study protocol and follow-up schedule. Those conditions should be discussed with the patient before registration in the trial;\n17. Patients with history of non-compliance to medical regimens or unwilling or unable to comply with the protocol;\n18. Individual deprived of liberty or placed under the authority of a tutor.",
