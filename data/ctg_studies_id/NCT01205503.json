    "eligibilityCriteria": "Inclusion Criteria:\n\nParticipants must have histologically or cytologically confirmed breast cancer or non-hodgkin lymphoma and independent of protocol eligibility be determined to require one of the chemotherapy regimens listed below\n\nParticipants must require as standard-of-care treatment a chemotherapy regimen that includes one of the following combinations:\n\n* doxorubicin 60 mg/m2 and cyclophosphamide 600 mg/m2;\n* doxorubicin 50 mg/m2, cyclophosphamide 500 mg/m2, and docetaxel 75 mg/m2;\n* doxorubicin 50 mg/m2, cyclophosphamide 750 mg/m2, vincristine 1.4 mg/m2 (capped at 2 mg dose), and prednisone 100 mg +/- rituximab 375 mg/m2\n\nAge \\>18 years.Because these treatment regimens are rarely used in pediatric oncology, children are excluded from this study but will be eligible for future pediatric phase 2 trials.\n\nLife expectancy of greater than 6 months.\n\nZubrod performance score 2 or better.\n\nPatients must have normal organ and marrow function as defined below:\n\n* leukocytes \\>3,000/microliter (mcL) (unless due to cancer in marrow)\n* absolute neutrophil count \\>1,500/mcL (unless due to cancer in marrow)\n* platelets \\>100,000/mcL (unless due to cancer in marrow)\n* total bilirubin \\<1.5 X normal institutional limits\n* Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) or serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase (SGOT)/Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) or serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase (SGPT) \\<2.5 X institutional upper limit of normal\n* creatinine within normal institutional limits OR\n* creatinine clearance \\>60 mL/min/1.73 m2 for patients with creatinine levels above institutional normal\n* left ventricular function \u2265 50 % ejection fraction\n\nBecause the standard of care chemotherapy agents are known to be teratogenic, women of child-bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry and for the duration of study participation. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately.\n\nAbility to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\nPatients who have had chemotherapy or radiotherapy within 4 weeks (6 weeks for nitrosoureas or mitomycin C) prior to entering the study or those who have not recovered from adverse events due to agents administered more than 4 weeks earlier.\n\nPatients may not be receiving any other investigational agents\n\nPatients with known brain metastases should be excluded from this clinical trial because progressive neurologic dysfunction would confound the evaluation of neuro-cognitive outcomes.\n\nHistory of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic composition to mesna or other agents used in the study (ie. sulfur containing drugs including \"sulfa antibiotics\" and celecoxib).\n\nPatients requiring ongoing pharmacologic treatment of dementia are excluded.\n\nUncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements.\n\nPregnant women are excluded from this study because the chemotherapy agents have known teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there is a potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with chemotherapy, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated with chemotherapy.\n\nHIV-positivity is NOT a specific exclusion criteria.",
