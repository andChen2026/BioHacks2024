(Significant increase of liver function test is defined as 50% increase of absolute amount of ASAT/ALAT.)\n* Patients in whom standard imaging work-up of MBC was recently (\u2264 28 days) performed. Standard imaging must include: CT chest/abdomen, 18F-FDG-PET and bone scintigraphy.\n* Patient with measurable or clinically evaluable (bone only) disease on recent standard work up of MBC are eligible.\n* Metastatic lesion(s) of which a histological biopsy can safely be obtained according to standard clinical care procedures.\n* Primary tumor blocks available for confirmatory central laboratory ER/HER2 testing in the UMCG. If available a snap frozen sample of the primary tumor will also be centralized in the University Medical Center Groningen (UMCG).\n* WHO performance status 0-2.\n* Patient is able to undergo PET imaging procedures.\n* Age \\>18 years of age, willing and able to comply with the protocol as judged by the investigator.\n* Signed written informed consent.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Contraindications for systemic treatment (as will be assigned based on biopsy and experimental scan results), either chemotherapy, hormonal therapy or anti-HER2 therapy, based on clinical judgment of treating medical oncologist and patient history.\n* Pregnant or lactating women.\n* Prior allergic reaction to immunoglobulins or immunoglobulin allergy.\n* Inability to comply with study procedures.\n* Rapidly progressive (visceral) disease requiring rapid initiation of chemotherapy.",
