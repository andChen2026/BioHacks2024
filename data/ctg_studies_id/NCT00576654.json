    "eligibilityCriteria": "Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Patients must have histologically or cytologically confirmed diagnosis of malignancy that is metastatic or unresectable and for which standard curative or palliative measures do not exist or are no longer effective or for whom CPT-11 treatment would be a viable therapy regimen; patients with solid hematologic malignancies (Hodgkin's and non-Hodgkin's lymphomas) may be included as long as a bone marrow has been performed within 6 weeks of treatment\n* Patients enrolled on the expansion portion of the study will consist of two cohorts: those patients who are triple-negative, BRCA-mutant positive and those patients who have triple-negative, non-BRCA mutated breast cancer\n* Patients enrolled on the dose escalation for intermittent ABT-888 portion of the study must histologically or cytologically confirmed diagnosis of malignancy that is metastatic or unresectable and for which standard curative or palliative measures do not exist or are no longer effective or for whom CPT-11 treatment would be a viable therapy regimen; patients with solid hematologic malignancies (Hodgkin's and non-Hodgkin's lymphomas) may be included as long as a bone marrow has been performed within 6 weeks of treatment\n* Patient must have measurable disease per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) guidelines\n* Patients must have tumors determined to be easily accessible for biopsy (e.g. pleural-based lesions, peripheral lymph nodes, soft tissue metastases, large liver metastases, etc)\n* Prior chemotherapy is allowed; patients must not have received chemotherapy for 4 weeks prior to the initiation of study treatment and must have full recovery from any acute effects of any prior chemotherapy; patients must not have had nitrosoureas or mitomycin C for 6 weeks prior to the initiation of study treatment\n* Prior radiation therapy is allowed; patients must not have received minimal radiation therapy (=\\< 5% of their total marrow volume) within 3 weeks prior to the initiation of study treatment; otherwise, patients must not have received radiation therapy (\\> 5% of their total marrow volume) within 4 weeks prior to the initiation of study treatment; patients who have received prior radiation to 50% or more of their total marrow volume will be excluded\n* Prior experimental (non-Food and Drug Administration \\[FDA\\] approved) therapies and immunotherapies are allowed; patients must not have received these therapies for 4 weeks prior to the initiation of study treatment and must have full recovery from any acute effects of these therapies\n* Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status =\\< 2 (Karnofsky \\>= 60%)\n* Life expectancy of greater than 12 weeks\n* Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) \\>= 1,500/mcL\n* Platelets (PLT) \\>= 100,000/mcL\n* Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) =\\< 2.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN); if liver metastases are present, =\\< 5 x ULN\n* Bilirubin =\\< 1.5 x ULN\n* Creatinine =\\< 1.5 x ULN OR calculated or measured creatinine clearance \\>= 60 mL/min/1.73 m\\^2 for patients with creatinine above institutional normal\n* Women of child-bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry, for the duration of study participation, and for three months following completion of study therapy; should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately\n* Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document\n* All patients must provide archival tissue block or paraffin sample from archival tissue block (approximately 10 sections) for use in pharmacodynamic correlative studies (NOT required for patients enrolled on the dose escalation for intermittent ABT-888 portion of the study)\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Patients who have had chemotherapy or radiotherapy within 4 weeks (6 weeks for nitrosoureas or mitomycin C) prior to entering the study or those who have not recovered from adverse events due to agents administered more than 4 weeks earlier; patients who have been administered ABT-888 as part of a single or limited dosing study, such as a phase 0 study, should not necessarily be excluded from participating in this study solely because of receiving prior ABT-888\n* Patients may not have received any other investigational agents within 4 weeks of study entry\n* History of allergic reactions attributed to the following:\n\n  * Camptothecin derivatives (e.g., topotecan \\[topotecan hydrochloride\\], irinotecan, or exatecan \\[exatecan mesylate\\])\n  * Any ingredients contained within the liquid irinotecan solution (e.g., sorbitol) or\n  * Any antiemetics or antidiarrheals appropriate for administration with study therapy (e.g., loperamide or dexamethasone)\n* Patients must not receive any other anti-cancer therapy (cytotoxic, biologic, radiation, or hormonal other than for replacement) while on this study except for medications that are prescribed for supportive care but may potentially have an anti-cancer effect (i.e. megestrol acetate, bisphosphonates); these medications must have been started 1 month prior to enrollment on this study; in addition, men receiving treatment for prostate cancer will be maintained at castrate levels of testosterone by continuation of luteinizing-releasing hormone agonists\n* Patients with uncontrolled seizures\n* Patients with known active brain metastases should be excluded from this clinical trial; patients with prior treated brain metastases are allowed, providing that they were not accompanied by seizures and that a baseline brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan prior to study entry demonstrates no current evidence of brain metastases; all patients with central nervous system (CNS) metastases must be stable for \\> 3 months after treatment and off steroid treatment prior to study enrollment\n* Any patient requiring chronic maintenance of white blood cell counts or granulocyte counts through the use of growth factor support (e.g. Neulasta, Neupogen)\n* Any patient requiring cytochrome P450 family 3, subfamily A, polypeptide 4 (CYP3A4) isoform-inducing drugs (e.g. phenytoin, phenobarbital, carbamazepine, rifampin, rifabutin, ketoconazole, St. John's wort) will be excluded; CYP3A4-inducing drugs should be discontinued at least 2 weeks prior to the first cycle of irinotecan\n* Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to:\n\n  * Ongoing or active infection\n  * Symptomatic congestive heart failure\n  * Unstable angina pectoris\n  * Cardiac arrhythmia or\n  * Psychiatric illness or social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements\n* Pregnant women are excluded from this study;
