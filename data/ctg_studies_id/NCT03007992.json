Female patient \u2265 18 years of age\n4. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 0-1, which the investigator assesses as being stable at time of screening\n5.

Documented locally advanced or metastatic disease, previously untreated by palliative chemotherapy and not amenable to any curative treatment\n8. Hormone receptor positive disease determined by \u2265 1% positive stained cells for oestrogen and/or progesterone receptor by immunohistochemistry on the primary tumour or on a metastatic site\n9. HER2-negative disease assessed by 0-1+ immuno-histochemistry (IHC) or 2+ IHC with negative fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) or CISH) on the primary tumour or on a metastatic site\n10. Availability of archival (from the most recently obtained sample) or fresh tumour tissue from patients included in the trial for the analysis of relevant metronomic biomarkers; one tumour block (preferred) or a minimum of 12 (recommended: 15) unstained slides to be provided\n11.

Prior (neo-)adjuvant chemotherapy is allowed, if the interval between end of chemotherapy and date of registration is \\> 12 months\n13. Prior treatment with everolimus and/or palbociclib in the frame of hormonal therapy is allowed\n14.
