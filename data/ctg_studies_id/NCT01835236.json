    "eligibilityCriteria": "SELECTION OF PATIENTS (MOST IMPORTANT CRITERIA)\n\nInclusion criteria for first-line therapy\n\n\u2022 Histologically confirmed breast cancer with distant metastases\n\nNote:\n\n1. A biopsy from the primary tumor or a metastasis can be used for diagnosis.\n2. Patients with non-measurable lesions are eligible.\n3. Patients with inoperable, locally advanced breast cancer with lymph node metastases other than ipsilateral locoregional (axillary, infraclavicular, parasternal) or other distant metastases are eligible.\n4. Patients with bone metastases with or without bone targeted therapy (bisphosphonates, denosumab) are eligible.\n5. Patients with de-novo Stage IV disease are eligible.\n\n   * HER2-positive tumor according to central pathology testing for HER2\n\nNote:\n\n1. A formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) biopsy from the primary tumor or a metastasis has to be used for HER2 status determination. If a biopsy is available from a metastasis, the HER2 testing should be performed using the metastasis.\n2. Fine needle aspiration is not acceptable for HER 2 testing. \u2022 Women aged \u226518 years\n\n   \u2022 WHO performance status 0 to 2\n   * Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction (LVEF) \u226550% as determined by either ECHO or MUGA\n   * Adequate organ function, evidenced by the following laboratory results:\n\n   Neutrophils \\>1.5x109/L, platelets \\>100x109/L, hemoglobin \u226590g/L, total bilirubin \u22641.5xULN (unless the patients has documented Gilbert's disease), AST \u22643xULN, ALT \u22643xULN, AP \u22642.5xULN (except in patients with bone metastases: AP \u22645xULN), creatinine \u22641.5xULN\n\n   Exclusion criteria for first-line therapy\n\n   \u2022 Prior chemotherapy for inoperable locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer\n\n   Note:\n\n   Prior neoadjuvant/adjuvant chemotherapy is allowed if doses for anthracyclines have not exceeded 720mg/m2 and 240mg/m2 for epirubicin and doxorubicin, respectively.\n\n   - Re-exposure to paclitaxel is permitted, if the last dose of taxane was given at least 1 year before randomization.\n\n   - Re-exposure to vinorelbine is permitted, if the last dose of vinorelbine was given at least 1 year before randomization.\n   * Prior anti-HER2 treatment for metastatic or inoperable breast cancer\n\n   Note:\n\n   Prior neoadjuvant/adjuvant anti-HER2 treatment with trastuzumab and/or lapatinib is allowed.\n\n   \u2022 More than one endocrine treatment line for metastatic or inoperable breast cancer exceeding a duration of 1 month\n\n   Note:\n\n<!-- -->\n\n1. Adjuvant endocrine treatment is not counted as one line.\n2. Patients progressing on endocrine treatment: this specific endocrine treatment must have been stopped at least 2 weeks prior to randomization.\n\n   \u2022 Prior treatment with pertuzumab and/or T-DM1\n\n   \u2022 Known leptomeningeal or CNS metastases\n\n   Note:\n\n   A brain MRI or CT scan is mandatory in case of clinical suspicion of CNS metastases.\n\n   \u2022 Single bone metastasis treated with radiotherapy (if the bone metastasis is the only tumor lesion)\n\n   Inclusion criteria for second-line therapy \u2022 At least one dose of trial therapy in the first-line treatment phase of this trial\n\n   \u2022 \u2022 Proven disease progression on first-line therapy or radiotherapy of a bone metastasis\n\n   Notes:\n\n   First new parenchymal CNS metastases only do not count as progression requiring the initiation of second line trial treatment. Radiotherapy of a single area only for pain control is allowed and will not count as PD.\n\n   \u2022 Adequate organ function, evidenced by the following laboratory results: Neutrophils \\>1.5x109/L, platelets \\>100x109/L, hemoglobin \u226590g/L, total bilirubin \u22641.5xULN (unless the patients has documented Gilbert's disease), AST \u22643xULN, AP \u22642.5xULN (except in patients with bone metastases: AP \u22645xULN), creatinine \u22641.5ULN\n\n   \u2022 LVEF \u226550% as determined by either ECHO or MUGA\n\n   \u2022 QoL questionnaire has been completed.\n\n   Exclusion criteria for second-line therapy\n\n   \u2022 Termination of first-line therapy with trastuzumab/pertuzumab due to unacceptable toxicity without objective evidence of disease progression\n\n   \u2022 CNS metastases that are untreated, symptomatic, or require therapy to control symptoms, as well as a history of radiation, surgery, or other therapy, including steroids, to control symptoms from CNS metastases within 2 months (60 days) before registration\n\n   \u2022 Peripheral neuropathy of CTCAE grade \u22653\n   * Interstitial lung disease (ILD) or pneumonitis grade \u22653\n   * Any other adverse event which has not recovered to CTCAE grade \u22641 (except alopecia)",
