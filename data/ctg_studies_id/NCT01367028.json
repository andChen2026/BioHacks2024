If there is any clinical suspicion of brain metastasis, a CT-scan or MRI of the brain must be conducted within 4 weeks prior to randomization.\n* Serious concurrent disease which could affect compliance with the protocol or interpretation of results, including, but not limited to:\n\n  * Active infection requiring i.v. antibiotics\n  * Uncontrolled hypertension\n  * Clinically significant history of cardiovascular disease as indicated by: cerebrovascular accident or stroke; myocardial infarction; unstable angina; NYHA Grade II or greater CHF; cardiac arrhythmia requiring medication; clinically significant valvular heart disease.\n  * Dyspnea at rest necessitating supportive oxygen therapy or with significant pleural effusions\n  * Poorly controlled diabetes mellitus\n  * History or evidence upon physical/neurological examination of CNS disease unrelated to cancer (e.g. uncontrolled seizures) unless adequately treated with standard medical therapy\n  * History or evidence of inherited bleeding diathesis or coagulopathy with the risk of bleeding\n  * History of abdominal fistula, GI perforation, or intra-abdominal abscess within 6 months of randomization\n  * Serious non-healing wound, peptic ulcer, or bone fracture\n  * Clinically significant malabsorption syndrome, ulcerative colitis, disease affecting GI function, resection of the stomach or small bowel, or inability to take oral medication\n  * Uncorrected hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia\n  * Organ allografts requiring immunosuppressive therapy\n* Evidence of any other disease, metabolic or psychological dysfunction, physical examination finding, or clinical laboratory finding giving reasonable suspicion of a disease or condition that contraindicates the use of an investigational drug, may affect patient compliance with study routines, or place the patient at high risk from treatment related complications.\n* Known hypersensitivity to any of the study drugs/excipients.\n* Hypersensitivity to Chinese hamster ovary cell products or other recombinant human or humanized antibodies.\n\nOther\n\n* Pregnant, lactating females or women of childbearing potential without a negative pregnancy test\n* Fertile males or females of childbearing potential\n* Patients not accessible for treatment or follow-up",
