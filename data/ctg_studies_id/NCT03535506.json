Pregnancy testing does not need to be pursued in patients who are judged as postmenopausal before enrollment, or who have undergone tubal ligation, bilateral oophorectomy, total hysterectomy.\n* Willingness to undergo adequate contraception if childbearing potential; women of childbearing potential and male patients randomized into treatment Group A must use adequate contraception for the duration of protocol treatment and for 3 months after the last treatment with palbociclib if they are in Group A; adequate contraception is defined as one highly effective form (i.e. abstinence, (fe)male sterilization) OR two effective forms (e.g. non-hormonal IUD and condom / occlusive cap with spermicidal foam / gel / film / cream / suppository).\n\nExclusion Criteria for all patients (Groups A and B):\n\n* Concurrent therapy with other Investigational Products\n* Invasive carcinoma present in the diagnostic biopsy, microinvasion is allowed\n* Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including (active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, diabetes, pulmonary embolism in the past 6 months, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements).\n* Unable to comply with study requirements\n* Hormone therapies containing estrogen, progesterone, GnRH agonists and antagonists within 4 weeks from diagnostic biopsy.\n* Therapy with any CDK inhibitor in the past 3 months\n\nExclusion criteria specific to treatment Group A:\n\n* History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of chemical or biologic composition similar to palbociclib\n* Presence of a condition that would interfere with enteric absorption of palbociclib\n* Pregnant women, or women of childbearing potential without a negative pregnancy test (serum or urine) within 7 days prior to enrollment; breastfeeding must be discontinued prior to study entry (Group A only).\n* Patients on combination antiretroviral therapy, i.e. those who are HIV+ (potential for pharmacokinetic interactions or increased immunosuppression with palbociclib).\n* Patients receiving any medications or substances that are potent inhibitors or inducers of CYP3A isoenzymes within 7 days of enrollment or during participation on study\n* Patients with clinically significant history of liver disease, including viral or other known hepatitis, current alcohol abuse, or cirrhosis, etc.",
