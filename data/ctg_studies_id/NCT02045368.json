Prior systemic chemotherapy, immunotherapy, or biological therapy, radiation therapy and/or surgery are allowed; however prior use of methotrexate allowed if \\> 6 months prior to study entry. Intrathecal methotrexate is allowed prior to and during treatment per investigator discretion. Time since prior therapy and the first dose of study drug:\n\n    * At least 2 weeks since prior radiation, non cytotoxic small molecule drugs (e.g., tyrosine kinase inhibitors such as erlotinib and hormonal agents such as letrozole), prior major surgery (surgery defined as a surgery involving a risk to the life of the patient; specifically: an operation upon an organ within the cranium, chest, abdomen, or pelvic cavity), prior systemic FDA approved therapy\n\n      * At least 3 weeks since prior antineoplastic therapy\n      * At least 4 weeks since exposure to monoclonal antibodies (chimeric or fully human)\n      * At least 6 weeks since prior nitrosureas or mitomycin-C\n12. Patient must have recovered from the acute toxic effects (\u2264 grade 1 CTCAE v.4.0) of previous anti-cancer treatment prior to study enrollment; the only exception is that grade 2 neuropathy is permitted\n13. Adequate organ function within 14 days of study registration defined as the following laboratory values:\n\n    * Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) \u2265 1.5 X 10\\^9/L\n    * Hemoglobin \u2265 9g/dL\\* (Patient may not have had a transfusion within 7 days of blood draw.)\n    * Platelets \u2265 100 X 10\\^9/L\\* (Patient may not have had a transfusion within 7 days of blood draw.)\n    * Total bilirubin \u2264 1.5 X upper limit of normal (ULN)\n    * Alkaline phosphatase, aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) \u2264 3 X ULN \\< 5 X ULN is acceptable if liver has tumor involvement)\n    * Serum creatinine \u2264 1.5 X ULN\n    * Creatinine clearance \u2265 60 ml/min\\^2 or glomerular filtration rate (GFR) \u2265 60 ml/min\\^2 or 24 hour urine creatinine clearance \u2265 50 ml/min\n    * Laboratory values for lymphoma patients:\n\n      * Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) \u2265 1.0 X 10\\^9/L\n      * Hemoglobin \u2265 8g/dL\n      * Platelets \u2265 50 X 10\\^9/L\n      * Total bilirubin \u2264 1.5 X ULN\n      * Alkaline phosphatase, AST and ALT \u2264 3 X ULN (\\< 5 X ULN is acceptable if liver has tumor involvement)\n      * Serum creatinine \u2264 1.5 X ULN\n      * Creatinine clearance \u2265 60 ml/min\\^2 or GFR \u2265 60 ml/min\\^2 or 24 hour urine creatinine clearance \u2265 50 ml/min\n14.

Other severe acute or chronic medical or psychiatric conditions, or laboratory abnormality that may increase the risk associated with study participation or investigational product administration or may interfere with the interpretation of study results and, in the judgment of the investigator, would make the patient inappropriate for enrollment in this study.\n10.
