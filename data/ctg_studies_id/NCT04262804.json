Male or female, age \u2265 18 years old at the time of screening.\n3. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1\n4. Subject has histologically confirmed HER2 positive metastatic breast cancer. Note: the definition of HER2 positive is to have at least once 3+ by IHC, FISH positive and CISH positive in the pathological test/retesting conducted at least once by investigational site or qualified central lab which met national standard.\n5. Have received at least 2 prior lines of anti-HER2 directed therapy in the metastatic setting (mandatory to have trastuzumab, and other anti-HER2 agents e.g. lapatinib, pyrotinib, pertuzumab, or T-DM1), regardless of having received (neo)adjuvant anti-HER2 therapy or not\n6. Have received treatment with no more than three lines of therapy overall in the metastatic setting (including anti-HER2 targeted therapy or chemotherapy) and must have disease progressed on or after, the most recent line of therapy. per RECIST 1.1.\n\n   * Prior radiotherapy, chemotherapy, hormonal therapies are allowed\n   * Endocrine therapies will not be considered as previous lines of therapy in the metastatic setting.\n   * Prior neo-adjuvant or adjuvant therapy that resulted in relapse within 6 months of the completion of therapy will be considered a line of treatment for metastatic disease.\n   * Dose interruptions, delays, pauses during previous therapy, or changes in therapy to manage toxicity will not constitute a new line of therapy provided disease progression did not occur\n7. Subject has at least one measurable lesion per RECIST 1.1.\n8.

If subject has known and treated brain metastasis, baseline CT or MRI data within 4 weeks prior to randomization are mandatory to be obtained. Subject should have received brain metastasis treatment for at least four weeks before randomization.

Subject has any investigational treatment within 4 weeks prior to randomization (including margetuximab)\n5. Subject has history of major surgery with unrecovered surgical effect within 4 weeks prior to randomization.\n6. Subject has other malignant tumor (complete cured in situ cervical cancer, cutaneous basal cell carcinoma or cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma are not included) within 5 years prior to randomization.\n7.
