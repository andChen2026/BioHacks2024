    "eligibilityCriteria": "Inclusion Criteria:\n\nThe study population includes two type of patients:\n\n* Women who underwent oncoplastic procedures for breast conservation. This group is made up of women with breast cancer in whom the Breast Unit tumor committee recommended a breast-conserving surgical procedure. The techniques included for this study are vertical mammoplasty, horizontal mammoplasty, and local flaps by displacement or rotation.\n* Women undergoing a skin or skin/nipple-sparing mastectomy with immediate breast reconstruction. This group is made up of patients with a diagnosis of breast carcinoma, who require a mastectomy as surgical treatment, as well as those high-risk women whose mastectomy is aimed at reducing the risk of breast cancer. The surgical techniques included in this group are Carlson type 1, 2, 3 and 4 skin-sparing mastectomies and nipple and skin-sparing mastectomies using inframammary and vertical approaches. In all patients, the type of breast reconstruction will be the placement of a definitive implant in the prepectoral position.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n- Women with iodine allergy or thyroid disease are excluded from this study.",
