Participated as a subject in a clinical trial within 4 weeks prior to the first dose of the study drug;\n6. Patients who have undergone major organ surgery (excluding needle biopsy) or significant trauma within 4 weeks prior to the first dose of the study drug, or require selective surgery during the study;\n7. Previously received allogeneic bone marrow transplantation or solid organ transplantation;\n8. Presence of third space fluid accumulation (such as massive pleural effusion and ascites) that cannot be controlled by drainage or other methods;\n9. The adverse reactions to previous antitumor treatment have not recovered to CTCAE 5.0 grade \u2264 1 (except for alopecia and other toxicities judged by the investigator to have no safety risk);\n10.
