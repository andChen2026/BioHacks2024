    "eligibilityCriteria": "Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Histologically confirmed breast cancer that overexpresses HER-2/NEU with evidence of metastatic disease and/or chest wall recurrence prior to randomization\n* HER-2/NEU overexpression is defined as 3+ HER-2 positivity as measured by immunohistochemistry OR HER-2 gene amplification as measured by fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH, e.g. Vysis), per American Society of Clinical Oncology guidelines\n\n  * NOTE: representative diagnostic tissue must be submitted for central diagnostic review for confirmation of HER-2/NEU overexpression within two weeks following patient randomization\n* Evaluable (measurable or non-measurable) disease is allowed if confirmed within 4 weeks prior to randomization\n* Prior endocrine treatment in the adjuvant or metastatic setting is allowed, provided last dose given \\>= 2 weeks prior to randomization\n* Radiation therapy is allowed provided last dose is given \\>= 3 weeks prior to randomization\n* Adjuvant trastuzumab therapy for breast cancer is allowed provided last dose was given \\>= 12 months prior to diagnosis of recurrence\n* Adjuvant or neoadjuvant taxane therapy for breast cancer is allowed provided last dose was given \\>= 12 months prior to diagnosis of recurrence\n* Adjuvant or neoadjuvant therapy with lapatinib is allowed provided last dose is given \\>= 4 weeks prior to diagnosis of recurrence\n* Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1\n* Absolute neutrophil count \\>= 1,000/mm\\^3\n* Platelet count \\>= 100,000/mm\\^3\n* Total bilirubin =\\< 1.5 mg/dL\n* Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) =\\< 2 times upper limit of normal (ULN) (=\\< 5 times normal in patients with known liver involvement)\n* Serum creatinine =\\< 1.5 mg/dL\n* Urine protein: creatinine ratio =\\< 0.5 OR 24-hour urine protein \\< 1000 mg\n* International normalized ratio (INR) =\\< 1.5 X ULN\n* Partial thromboplastin time (PTT) =\\< 1.5 X ULN\n* Multi gated acquisition scan (MUGA) scan or echocardiogram (ECHO) within 6 weeks prior to randomization with an left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) above the institutional lower limit of normal\n* Patients must be able to understand and provide signed and dated written informed consent\n* Major surgical procedure within 4 weeks prior to randomization is not allowed (except for non-operative biopsy, which would not be considered major surgery); treatment can not begin until seven (7) days after placement of a vascular access device\n* Women must not be pregnant or breastfeeding; all females of childbearing potential must have a blood or urine test within 2 weeks prior to randomization to rule out pregnancy; women of childbearing potential and sexually active males must use an accepted and effective method of contraception\n* Patients on full-dose anticoagulants (e.g., warfarin) with PT/INR \\> 1.5 may be eligible provided that both of the following criteria are met:\n\n  * The patient has an in-range INR (usually between 2 and 3) on a stable dose of oral anticoagulant or on a stable dose of low molecular weight heparin\n  * The patient has not active bleeding or pathological condition that carries a high risk of bleeding (e.g., tumor involving major vessels or known varices)\n* Patients with a concurrent active malignancy except carcinoma in situ of the cervix or non-melanoma skin cancers (unless disease-free for at least 5 years at study entry) are not allowed\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Prior chemotherapy, trastuzumab, or bevacizumab for metastatic breast cancer\n* Patients who have had a cumulative dose of doxorubicin of greater than 360 mg/m\\^2 or epirubicin of greater than 640 mg/m\\^2 in the adjuvant or neo-adjuvant setting at any time\n* Patients with grade 2-4 neuropathy\n* Patients with a history or radiologic evidence of central nervous system (CNS) disease\n* Patients have a current non-healing wound or fracture\n* Patients have a hypersensitivity to paclitaxel or drugs using the vehicle Cremophor, Chinese hamster ovary cell products or other recombinant human antibodies\n* Patients have a serious medical or psychiatric illness that would prevent ability to safely participate or provide informed consent\n* Patients using any of the following drugs known to inhibit platelet function are not eligible: dipyridamole (Persantine), ticlopidine (Ticlid), clopidogrel (Plavix) and cilostazol (Pletal)\n* Clinically significant cardiovascular disease, including:\n\n  * History of cerebrovascular (CVA) within 6 months\n  * Uncontrolled hypertension\n  * Myocardial infarction or unstable angina within 6 months\n  * New York Heart Association class II or greater congestive heart failure, serious cardiac arrhythmia requiring medication, unstable angina pectoris\n  * Clinically significant peripheral vascular disease",
