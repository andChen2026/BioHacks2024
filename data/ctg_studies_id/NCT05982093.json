Women of CBP must be willing to use highly effective methods of contraception. Contraception must continue during the trial treatment and after stopping the treatment received according to protocol. Highly effective contraception methods include:\n\n    * Total abstinence (when this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the patient).

Known hypersensitivity to any of the study drugs, including excipients.\n15. Known difficulty in tolerating oral medications or conditions which would impair absorption of oral medications such as: uncontrolled nausea or vomiting (i.e., CTCAE \u2265 Grade 3 despite antiemetic therapy), ongoing gastrointestinal obstruction/motility disorder, malabsorption syndrome, or prior gastric bypass.\n16. History of or clinical evidence of significant co-morbidities that, in the judgment of the investigator, may interfere with the conduction of the study, the evaluation of response, or with informed consent.\n17.
