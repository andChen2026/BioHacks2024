Contraception use must continue for the duration of study treatment and for at least 6 months after the last dose of study treatment. Male patients should use condoms for the duration of the study.

Patients receiving AC/FEC in a similar fashion to the study treatment prescribed for adjuvant or neoadjuvant treatment of breast cancer will be allowed to enroll in the study after the completion of their AC/FEC. No other prior history of cardiotoxic chemotherapy is allowed.\n* Active cardiac history.\n* Current chronic daily treatment with oral corticosteroids or equivalent.\n* Patients with severe dyspnea at rest or requiring supplementary oxygen therapy.\n* Active, unresolved infections at screening.\n* Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B virus (HBV), or hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection.\n* Major surgery within 4 weeks before enrollment that is unrelated to the breast cancer.\n* Patients for whom concomitant radiotherapy + T-DM1 may be contraindicated yet radiation therapy is planned.\n* Known hypersensitivity to any of the study drugs or derivatives, including murine proteins.\n* Grade \u2265 2 peripheral neuropathy at Baseline.",
