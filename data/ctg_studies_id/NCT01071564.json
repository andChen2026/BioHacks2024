otherwise, patients must not have received radiation therapy (\\> 5% of their total marrow volume) within 4 weeks prior to the initiation of study treatment; patients who have received prior radiation to 50% or more of their total marrow volume will be excluded\n  * Other therapies: prior experimental (non-Food and Drug Administration \\[FDA\\] approved) therapies and immunotherapies are allowed; patients must not have received these therapies for 30 days or five half- lives of the drug prior to the initiation of study treatment and must have full recovery from any acute effects of these therapies;

should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while she or her partner are participating in this study and for 12 months after study participation, the patient should inform the treating physician immediately\n\n  * Pregnancy testing: women of childbearing potential are required to have a negative serum pregnancy test (with a sensitivity of at least 25 mIU/mL) within 10-14 days and within 24 hours prior to the first dose of RO4929097 or GDC-0449 (serum or urine); a pregnancy test (serum or urine) will be administered every cycle if their menstrual cycles are regular or every 2 weeks if their cycles are irregular while on study within the 24-hour period prior to the administration of study drug; a positive urine test must be confirmed by a serum pregnancy test; prior to dispensing study drug, the investigator must confirm and document the patient's use of two contraceptive methods, dates of negative pregnancy test, and confirm the patient's understanding of the teratogenic potential of RO4929097 and GDC-0449\n  * Female patients of childbearing potential are defined as follows:\n\n    * Patients with regular menses\n    * Patients, after menarche with amenorrhea, irregular cycles, or using a contraceptive method that precludes withdrawal bleeding\n    * Women who have had tubal ligation\n  * Female patients may be considered to NOT be of childbearing potential for the following reasons:\n\n    * The patient has undergone total abdominal hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy or bilateral oophorectomy\n    * The patient is medically confirmed to be menopausal (no menstrual period) for 24 consecutive months\n    * Pre-pubertal females; the parent or guardian of young female patients who have not yet started menstruation should verify that menstruation has not begun; if a young female patient reaches menarche during the study, then she is to be considered as a woman of childbearing potential from that time forward\n* Patient must have the ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document\n* Patients must have a corrected QT (QTc) interval of =\\< 450 msec in males and a QTc =\\< 470 msec in females as measured by electrocardiogram (ECG) using Bazett's formula\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Patients who have had chemotherapy or radiotherapy within 3 weeks (4 weeks for those who received radiation therapy of \\> 5% of their total marrow volume; 6 weeks for nitrosoureas or mitomycin C) prior to entering the study or those who have not recovered from toxicities related to prior therapy are not eligible to participate in this study; patients who have been administered GDC-0449 or RO4929097 as part of a single or limited dosing study, such as a phase 0 study, should not necessarily be excluded from participating in this study solely because of receiving prior GDC-0449 or RO4929097\n* Patients may not have received any other investigational agents within the preceding 30 days or five half- lives of the drug and must have full recovery from any acute effects of these investigational therapies\n* Patients must not have received prior treatment with either a gamma-secretase or hedgehog inhibitor\n* Patients with a requirement for antiarrhythmics or other medications known to prolong QTc\n* Patients must not receive any other anti-cancer therapy (cytotoxic, biologic, radiation, or hormonal other than for replacement) while on this study except for medications that are prescribed for supportive care but may potentially have an anti-cancer effect (i.e. megestrol acetate, bisphosphonates); these medications must have been started 1 month prior to enrollment on this study\n* Patients with a prior history of seizures\n* Patients with known active brain metastases will be excluded from this clinical trial; patients with prior treated brain metastases (treated and stable for \\>= 1 month) are allowed, providing that they were not accompanied by seizures and that a baseline brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan prior to study entry demonstrates no current evidence of progressive brain metastases\n* Any patient requiring chronic maintenance of white blood cell counts or granulocyte counts through the use of growth factor support (e.g. Neulasta, Neupogen)\n* HIV-positive patients on combination antiretroviral therapy are ineligible\n* Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements\n* Pregnant women are excluded from this study; breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated with GDC-0449 or RO4929097\n* Patients with malabsorption syndrome or other condition that would interfere with intestinal absorption; patients must be able to swallow tablets\n* Patients with clinically active liver disease, including active viral or other hepatitis or cirrhosis, are ineligible\n* Patients with uncontrolled hypocalcemia, hypomagnesemia, hyponatremia, hypophosphatemia or hypokalemia defined as less than the lower limit of normal for the institution, despite adequate electrolyte supplementation are excluded from this study\n* GDC is a cytochrome P450 2C9 (CYP2C9) inhibitor; CYP2C9 is an enzyme that metabolizes warfarin sodium (Coumadin) into an inactive metabolite; patients who are on warfarin anticoagulation are allowed to participate as long as they fit the following 4 criteria:\n\n  * They are therapeutic on a stable warfarin dose\n  * Their international normalized ratio (INR) target range is no greater than 3\n  * They are monitored with weekly INR testing\n  * They have no active bleeding or pathological condition that carries high risk of bleeding.\n  * Other anticoagulants, including enoxaparin (Lovenox) and fondaparinux (Arixtra) are also permitted\n* Caution should be exercised when dosing RO4929097 and GDC-0449 concurrently with CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP3A4 substrates; furthermore, patients who are taking concurrent medications that are strong inducers/inhibitors or substrates of CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP3A4 should be switched to alternative medications to minimize any potential risk; investigators will make every effort to switch to another agent and assess the eligibility of the patient to participate in this study\n* Baseline QTc \\> 450 msec in males and QTc \\> 470 msec in females by ECG using Bazett's formula\n* Patients without accessible tumor or who refuse serial biopsies",
