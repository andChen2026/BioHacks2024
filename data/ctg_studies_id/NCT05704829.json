Concurrent treatment with other experimental drugs and participation in another clinical trial with any investigational drug within 30 days prior to study entry\n8. Severe and relevant co-morbidity that would interact with the application of cytotoxic agents or the participation in the study/inadequate organ function\n9. Reasons indicating risk of poor compliance\n10. Woman of child-bearing potential defined as a woman physiologically capable of becoming pregnant, and not using highly effective methods of contraception during the study treatment and for 3 months after stopping the treatment.\n11.

Patients with a medical history of myocardial infarction (MI) within 6 months before randomisation, symptomatic congestive heart failure (CHF) (New York Heart Association Class II to IV), Subjects with troponin levels above ULN at screening (as defined by the manufacturer), and without any myocardial related symptoms, should have a cardiologic consultation before enrolment to rule out MI.\n14.
