oral, implantable, or injectable contraceptives may be affected by cytochrome P450 interactions, and are therefore not considered effective for this study\n* Other concurrent chemotherapy, immunotherapy, radiotherapy, or any ancillary therapy considered investigational (utilized for a non-Food and Drug Administration \\[FDA\\]-approved indication and in the context of a research investigation)\n* Co-morbid systemic illnesses or other severe concurrent disease which, in the judgment of the investigator, would make the patient inappropriate for entry into this study or interfere significantly with the proper assessment of safety and toxicity of the prescribed regimens\n* Immunocompromised patients (other than that related to the use of corticosteroids) including patients known to be human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) positive on highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) therapy\n* Receiving any other investigational agent which would be considered as a treatment for the primary neoplasm\n* Other active malignancy =\\< 3 years prior to registration; EXCEPTIONS: nonmelanotic skin cancer or carcinoma-in-situ of the cervix; Note: if there is a history of prior malignancy, they must not be receiving other specific treatment for their cancer\n* History of myocardial infarction =\\< 6 months prior to registration, or congestive heart failure requiring use of ongoing maintenance therapy for life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias\n* Uncontrolled hypertension, labile hypertension of history of poor compliance with antihypertensive medication\n* Patients with active, bleeding diathesis\n* Non-disease related- major surgery, =\\< 28 days or minor surgery =\\< 7 days prior to registration",
