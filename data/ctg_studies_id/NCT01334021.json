Patients with ER-positive (+) tumors deemed medically eligible for hormonal therapy, but not chemotherapy will be considered eligible for this protocol. Patients with ER-negative (-) tumors who are not candidates for adjuvant anthracycline based chemotherapy will be considered ineligible for this protocol. Patients who undergo biopsy and are later found to be ineligible for adjuvant therapy will be assessed for the primary objective, but will be excluded from the secondary objectives",
