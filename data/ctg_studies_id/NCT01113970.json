The presence of asymptomatic, previously irradiated, stable brain metastases for at least 3 months are not grounds for trial exclusion.\n* Presence of uncontrolled gastrointestinal malabsorption syndrome.\n* Any chemotherapy, radiotherapy or breast cancer directed biologic therapy during the study or within 3 weeks of study start. Mitomycin C or nitrosureas should not be given within 6 weeks of study entry. No washout period is required for hormonal therapies.\n* Concurrent radiation therapy is not permitted during treatment on protocol.\n* History of an invasive second primary malignancy diagnosed within the previous 3 years, except for Stage I endometrial or cervical carcinoma or prostate carcinoma treated surgically, and non-melanoma skin cancer.\n* Any medical, psychological or social condition that may interfere with the subject's ability to safely participate in the study.\n* Unwillingness to give written informed consent or unwillingness to participate or inability to comply with the protocol for the duration of the study.
