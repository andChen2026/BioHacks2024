Appropriate methods of birth control include abstinence, oral contraceptives, implantable hormonal contraceptives or double barrier method (diaphragm plus condom). Birth control must be used during the treatment period and continued for at least 6 months after the last dose of treatment with T-DM1 +/- abemaciclib\n  * Cases of pregnancy that occur during maternal exposures to T-DM1+/- abemaciclib, or cases of pregnancy in female partners/spouses of male patients, should be reported.
