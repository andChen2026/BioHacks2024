Participants with voluntarily signature Informed Consent Form (ICF) before the test, and have a full understanding of the test content, process and possible adverse reactions.\n  12. Participants with good compliance, were available for follow-up, and volunteered to comply with study regulations.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Eligible participants must not meet any of the following exclusion criteria:\n\n  1. Patients with the toxicity of previous antitumor therapy did not return to grade 1 or below (CTCAE 5.0 grade \\>1, excluding toxicity such as alopecia and other toxicity judged by investigators to be of no safety risk).\n  2. Patients with (including suspected) an allergic history to Paclitaxel, or any of its components, or allergic constitution (excluding mild asymptomatic seasonal allergy).\n  3. Patients with bleeding tendency or who are receiving thrombolytic or anticoagulant therapy.\n  4. Patients who had been treated with paclitaxel and were determined by the researchers to be resistant.\n  5. Patients with active central nervous system metastases,But patients with BMs who have received prior treatment and the metastases were stable can participate in the study.\n  6. Patients with cerebrovascular accident or transient ischemic attack in the previous 6 months were screened.\n  7. People with active infection and need anti-infection or antiviral treatment.\n  8. Patients have suffered from other malignant cancers within 5 years (except for cured basal cell carcinoma and cervical carcinoma in situ).\n  9. Concomitant diseases, as determined by the investigator, that seriously endangers the safety of subjects or affects their completion of the test(such as gastrointestinal bleeding, intestinal obstruction, intestinal paralysis, interstitial pneumonia, pulmonary fibrosis, etc).\n  10. Patients with a clear history of neurological or psychiatric disorders (including epilepsy and dementia).\n  11. Patients who have used any drugs that is CYP2C8 and/or CYP3A4 inducer or inhibitor Within 30 days before use of the test drug(including ketoconazole and other imidazole antifungal agents, verapamil, diazepam, quinidine, cyclosporine, teniposide, etoposide, vincrine, testosterone, 17-\u03b1 diethylstilbestrol, retinoic acid, quercetin, etc).\n  12.
