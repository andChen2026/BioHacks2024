    "eligibilityCriteria": "Participants will be drawn from a group of mothers whose children are participating in a study that will be conducted by our colleagues at Harvard Medical School. The Harvard study is a randomized trial among 750 3rd grade children (aged 9-11) to determine the impact of various types of vitamin D fortified and unfortified milk and vitamin D supplements on levels of 25(OHD), growth hormone, and IGF-1. Children in this study will be recruited at eleven primary schools in Ulaanbaatar. The trial will run from January through March 2009 and will include 375 girls; we estimate that their mothers will be roughly 30-45 years of age, and few will be pregnant.\n\nWe plan to recruit participants for our study at the time of the baseline blood draw in their daughters. Women ages 25-44 are eligible who are not pregnant or breastfeeding.",
