Patients with Small Cell Lung Cancer (SCLC) and Non-small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) must have measurable disease per RECIST v1.1. All other patients that do not have SCLC or NSCLC must have evaluable, but do not have to have measurable disease.\n\n   a. Patients with Breast Cancer (BC) enrolling on backfill (BF) cohorts must have measurable disease by RECIST v1.1.\n3. Age \u2265 18 years.\n4. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 0-1.\n5. Life expectancy greater than 12 weeks.\n6. Ability to swallow capsules by mouth.\n7. Have the following laboratory values:\n\n   1. Calculated creatinine clearance (CrCl) \u2265 60 mL/min/1.73 m\\^2 (by Cockroft-Gault formula); actual body weight must be used for CrCl unless Body Mass Index (BMI) \\> 30 kg/m\\^2 then lean body weight must be used.\n   2. Total bilirubin \u2264 1.5 \u00d7 ULN unless prior history of Gilbert's syndrome with Sponsor Medical Monitor approval\n   3. Aspartate transaminase and alanine transaminase \u2264 2.5 \u00d7 upper limit normal (ULN), or \u2264 5 \u00d7 ULN if due to liver involvement by tumor\n   4. Hemoglobin \u2265 9.0 g/dL (last transfusion \\> 14 days prior to Cycle 0 Day 1/ Cycle 1 Day 1)\n   5. Platelets \u2265 100 \u00d7 10\\^9 cells/L (last platelet transfusion \\> 14 days prior to C0D1/C1D1)\n   6. Absolute neutrophil count \u2265 1.2 \u00d710\\^9 cells/L (last dose of hematopoietic growth factors \\>14 days from Cycle 0 Day 1/ Cycle 1 Day 1)\n8. Male and female patients must be surgically sterile or commit to sexual abstinence or use 2 acceptable forms of birth control methods.\n9. Women of child-bearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test during Screening and a negative urine or serum test prior to Cycle 0 Day 1/ Cycle 1 Day 1.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\nA patient who meets any of the following exclusion criteria will be ineligible to participate in this study.\n\n1. Treatment with any of the following:\n\n   1. Targeted therapy \u2264 8 days or 5\u00d7 the terminal phase elimination half-lives, whichever is shorter, prior to Cycle 0 Day 1/ Cycle 1 Day 1.\n   2. Systemic anticancer treatment (excluding targeted therapy as described above) \u2264 14 days prior to Cycle 0 Day 1/ Cycle 1 Day 1.\n   3. Radiotherapy \u2264 28 days and palliative radiation \u2264 14 days prior to Cycle 0 Day 1/ Cycle 1 Day 1.\n   4. Immunotherapy \u2264 28 days prior to Cycle 0 Day 1/ Cycle 1 Day 1.\n   5.

Patients with chronic, but stable Grade 2 toxicities may be allowed to enroll after agreement between the Investigator and Sponsor Medical Monitor.\n3. Have known or suspected brain metastases or spinal cord compression, unless the condition has been asymptomatic and treated.\n4. Past medical history of interstitial lung disease, or any evidence of clinically active interstitial lung disease.\n5. Patient has a history of congestive heart failure (CHF) Class III/IV according to the New York Heart Association (NYHA) Functional Classification or serious cardiac arrhythmias requiring treatment.\n6. QTc interval (using Fridericia correction calculation) \\> 470 msec.\n7.

History of another primary malignancy \u2264 2 years prior to Cycle 0 Day 1/ Cycle 1 Day 1, except for adequately treated cancer.\n10. Malabsorption syndrome or other conditions that may interfere with adequate absorption of investigational product.\n11. Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, uncompensated respiratory, cardiac, hepatic, or renal disease, active infection (including untreated HIV and active clinical tuberculosis), symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements.\n12. Current endocrinopathies, unless in the opinion of the investigator endocrine complications are stable and well controlled and study participation does not jeopardize patient's risk.\n13.
