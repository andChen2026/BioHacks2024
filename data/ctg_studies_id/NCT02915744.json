Male patients should not donate sperm until 6 months following the last dose of study drug.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Last dose of anticancer therapy (including HER2-targeted therapy) within 14 days prior to randomization.\n* High-dose chemotherapy followed by stem cell transplantation (autologous or allogeneic).\n* Major surgery within 28 days prior to randomization.\n* Concomitant use of any anticancer therapy or use of any investigational agent(s).\n* Received prior treatment for cancer with a camptothecin-derived agent.\n* Lesions on imaging, by cerebrospinal fluid or with neurological findings that are consistent with leptomeningeal disease or meningeal carcinomatosis.\n* Chronic or acute GI disorders resulting in diarrhea of any severity grade.\n* Patients who are pregnant or lactating, plan to get pregnant, or have a positive serum pregnancy test prior to randomization.\n* Enzyme-inducing anti-epileptic drugs (EIAEDs) within 14 days of randomization.\n* Hepatitis B or C, tuberculosis, or HIV.\n* Cirrhosis.\n* Prior malignancy (other than breast cancer) unless diagnosed and definitively treated more than 5 years prior to randomization.\n* Daily use of oxygen supplementation.\n* Significant known cardiovascular impairment.\n* Prior treatment with NKTR-102.\n* Psychiatric illness, social situation, or geographical situation that preclude informed consent or limit compliance.\n* Known intolerance or hypersensitivity to any of the products used in this study or their excipients.\n* For patients selecting vinorelbine or gemcitabine as the TPC agent, patients may not receive yellow fever vaccine in the 28 days prior to randomization.",
