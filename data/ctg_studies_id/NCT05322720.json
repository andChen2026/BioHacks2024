Histopathologically and molecular pathologically confirmed HR positive, HER2 negative breast cancer (based on the latest test result);\n\n   Notes:\n\n   Positive HR is defined as positive estrogen receptor (ER), negative or positive progesterone receptor (PR) (\u22651% positive stained cells will be regarded as positive receptor); Negative HER2: negative immunohistochemical (IHC) result (0, 1+), or IHC result 2+ and negative result of in situ hybridization (ISH) amplification;\n4. Progression after endocrine therapy, being suitable for late-stage rescue chemotherapy, including the following conditions (meeting any one of them):\n\n   Primary endocrine resistance: recurrence less than two years after adjuvant endocrine therapy, or progression of disease less than 6 months after late-stage 1st-line endocrine therapy. For the patients with primary endocrine resistance, no use of other systematic therapy except endocrine therapy in relapsed/progressive period (the combined use of CDK4/6 inhibitor, Everolimus or HDAC inhibitor with endocrine therapy is allowed). There were no more than 2 lines of systemic therapy for advanced disease previously.\n\n   Secondary (acquired) endocrine resistance: recurrence more than 2 years after adjuvant endocrine therapy and within one year after discontinuation of it, or progression of disease \u22656 months after late-stage 1st-line endocrine therapy. For the patients with secondary (acquired) endocrine resistance, at least 1 line but no more than 3 lines of endocrine therapy for advanced disease are recommended (the combined use of CDK4/6 inhibitor, Everolimus or HDAC inhibitor with endocrine therapy is allowed), and the number of lines will not be calculated for adjuvant endocrine therapy. There were no more than 3 lines of systemic therapy for advanced disease previously.\n5. No use of chemotherapy for recurrent/metastatic breast cancer;\n6. At least one extracranial measurable lesion (RECIST 1.1);\n7. Peripheral blood absolute monocyte count (AMC) \\<0.25\u00d7109/L (tested by local laboratory, it is allowed to be repeated once if the AMC is ranged from 0.25\\~0.35\u00d7109/L at screening);\n8.

Recovery of toxicity induced by previous therapy (except alopecia) to grade 1 (National Cancer Institute - Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 5.0 \\[NCI CTCAE v5.0\\]) or normal level;\n11. Good organ function within 1 week prior to the first dose of study drug:\n\n    Hematology: no transfusion of platelet or any growth factor within 7 days prior to the screening visit, white blood cell count \u22653\u00d7109/L, absolute neutrophil count (ANC) \u22651.5\u00d7109/L, platelet count \u2265100\u00d7109/L, hemoglobin \u226590 g/L; Hepatic function: serum total bilirubin \u22641.5\u00d7 upper limit of normal (ULN), or total bilirubin \u22643\u00d7ULN in case of Gilbert's syndrome; aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) \u22642.5\u00d7ULN, or AST and ALT\u22645\u00d7ULN in case of hepatic metastasis; Renal function: serum creatinine \u22641.5\u00d7ULN.\n12.
