May receive concurrent radiation therapy to painful bone metastases or areas of impending bone fracture as long as radiation therapy is initiated prior to study entry. Those who have received prior radiotherapy must have recovered from any toxicity induced by this treatment (toxicity grade \u2264 1)\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n1. Chemotherapy, radiotherapy, or biological therapy within 3 weeks (6 weeks for nitrosoureas, mitomycin C or bevacizumab), or not recovered from the adverse events due to previous agents administered more than 4 weeks prior to Study Day 1.

Currently participating or has participated in a study with an investigational compound or device within 30 days of Study Day 1\n4. Known active CNS metastases and/or carcinomatous meningitis. However, patients with CNS metastases who have completed a course of therapy would be eligible for the study provided they are clinically stable for at least 1 month prior to entry as defined as: (1) no evidence of new or enlarging CNS metastasis (2)off steroids used to minimize surrounding brain edema\n5. Primary central nervous system tumor\n6. Known hypersensitivity to the components of study drug or its analogs\n7. History or current evidence of clinically significant heart disease including:\n\n   * congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris,\n   * cardiac arrhythmia,\n   * history or current evidence of a myocardial infarction during the last 6 months,and/or a current ECG tracing that is abnormal in the opinion of the treating Investigator,\n   * baseline QTc prolongation \\> 450 msec (Bazett's Formula). Medications included in Arizona CERT Lists 1 and 2 (Appendix D) must be excluded. The concomitant use of drugs that are associated with increased risk for QT prolongation should be avoided in patients with congenital long QT syndrome (Appendix D, Arizona CERT List 3). Similarly, the concomitant use of drugs that are weakly associated with QT prolongation should be generally avoided (Appendix D, Arizona CERT List 4). Arizona CERT List 3 and 4 drugs should be used at the discretion of the Investigator and restricted where applicable. Any therapy given with these drugs should be used with caution, and patients receiving these medications should be carefully monitored.\n8.
