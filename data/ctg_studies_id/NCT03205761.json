    "eligibilityCriteria": "Inclusion Criteria: (Any asterisked\\* are applicable as an inclusion criteria prior to perform the BRCA methylation testing via central testing)\n\n1. \\*The patient has signed and dated the informed consent document and it has been obtained before conducting any procedure specifically for the study.\n2. Female \u2265 18 years of age on day of signing informed consent.\n3. Patient with histological confirmation of breast cancer with evidence of advanced disease not amenable to resection or radiation therapy with curative intent.\n4. Documented Triple Negative (TN) disease by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and/or in situ hybridization based on local testing (preferably assessed on the most recent tumour biopsy available). TN is defined as negative hormone receptor status (\\< 1% of tumour cells with Estrogen Receptor (ER) and Progesterone Receptor (PgR) expression) and Human Epidermal growth factor Receptor 2 (HER2) negative status (defined as IHC score 0/1+ or negative by in situ hybridization defined according to local criteria).\n5. Patient must have received at least one previous regimen in the advance disease setting.\n6. Absence of deleterious or suspected deleterious germline mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2. Germinal BRCA mutational status will be centrally assessed in Myriad laboratories to check eligibility unless the test has been previously performed at Myriad and absence of mutations has been determined.\n7. Availability of a tumour tissue sample from the metastatic lesions (every effort should be done to obtain the sample after the previous therapeutic regimen for advanced disease) for central testing.\n8.

Olaparib is regarded as a compound with medium/high foetal risk, patients of childbearing potential and their partners, who are sexually active, must agree to the use of 2 highly effective forms of contraception in combination as listed below. This should be started from the signing of the informed consent and continue throughout period of taking study treatment and for at least 1 month after last dose of study drug or they must totally/truly abstain from any form of sexual intercourse (see below).\n\n    Acceptable non-hormonal birth control methods include:\n    * Total sexual abstinence. Abstinence must continue for the total duration of the study treatment and for at least 1 month after one dose. Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar ovulation, symptothermal, post-ovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception.\n    * Vasectomised sexual partner plus male condom. With participant assurance that partner received post-vasectomy confirmation of azoospermia.\n    * Tubal occlusion plus male condom.\n    * Intrauterine Device (IUD) plus male condom. Provided coils are copper-banded.\n\n    Acceptable hormonal methods:\n    * Normal and low dose combined oral pills plus male condom.\n    * Cerazette (desogestrel) plus male condom. Cerazette is currently the only highly efficacious progesterone based pill.\n    * Hormonal shot or injection (e.g., Depo-Provera) plus male condom.\n    * Etonogestrel implants (e.g. Implanon or Norplan) plus male condom.\n    * Norelgestromin/ethinyl estradiol (EE) transdermal system plus male condom.\n    * Intrauterine system (IUS) device (e.g., levonorgestrel releasing IUS -Mirena\u00ae) plus male condom.\n    * Intravaginal device plus male condom (e.g. EE and etonogestrel).\n15. \\*Patient is willing and able to comply with the protocol for the duration of the study including undergoing treatment and scheduled visits, laboratory tests and examinations and other study procedures including follow up.\n\nExclusion Criteria: (Any asterisked\\* are applicable as an inclusion criteria prior to perform the BRCA methylation testing via central testing)\n\n1.

Examples include, but are not limited to, uncontrolled ventricular arrhythmia, recent (within 3 months) myocardial infarction, uncontrolled major seizure disorder, unstable spinal cord compression, superior vena cava syndrome, moderate or severe hepatic impairment (according to Child-Pugh classification), an extensive interstitial bilateral lung disease on High Resolution Computed Tomography (HRCT) or any psychiatric disorder that prohibits obtaining informed consent.\n20. \\*Previous allogenic bone marrow transplant or double umbilical cord blood transplantation (dUCBT).\n21. \\*Whole blood transfusions in the last 120 days prior to entry to the study (packed red blood cells and platelet transfusions are acceptable, for timing refer to inclusion criteria no 10).",
