    "eligibilityCriteria": "Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Be able to give written informed consent and HIPAA authorization\n* Be 18 to 85 years old\n* Have been diagnosed with stage IV breast cancer of any type, platinum-resistant recurrent ovarian, peritoneal, endometrial, or fallopian tube cancer, or platinum-resistant recurrent or metastatic head and neck cancer and are anticipated to survive for at least three months\n* Have an ECOG Performance Status of 0-2\n* Able to take medication orally - up to four capsules in the morning (am) and four capsules in the evening (pm).\n* Be undergoing infusions of paclitaxel or nab-paclitaxel for treatment of breast cancer, platinum-resistant recurrent ovarian, peritoneal, endometrial, or fallopian tube cancer, or platinum-resistant recurrent or metastatic head and neck cancer and be determined to have at least a grade 1 neuropathy based on the CTCAE version 4.03 guidelines for peripheral sensory neuropathy. Breast cancer patients may also be treated concomitantly with monoclonal antibodies to HER2 such as trastuzumab (Herceptin) and pertuzumab (Perjeta). Patients with platinum-resistant ovarian, peritoneal, endometrial, or fallopian tube cancer or platinum-resistant recurrent or metastatic head and neck cancer may also be treated concomitantly with a vascular endothelial growth receptor 2 inhibitor such as bevacizumab (Avastin) or a checkpoint inhibitor.\n* Females must be either postmenopausal for at least 1 year or surgically sterile for at least 6 weeks. Females of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test at screening to be eligible for study participation, and agree to take appropriate precautions to avoid pregnancy from screening through follow-up.\n* Males must agree to take appropriate precautions to avoid fathering a child from screening through follow-up. The following methods have been determined to be more than 99% effective (\\<1% failure rate per year when used consistently and correctly) and are permitted under this protocol for use by the patient and his/her partner:\n\n  * Complete abstinence from sexual intercourse when this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the patient\n  * Double barrier methods including condom with spermicide in conjunction with use of an intrauterine device or condom with spermicide in conjunction with use of a diaphragm\n* Surgical sterilization (bilateral oopherectomy with or without hysterectomy, tubal ligation or vasectomy) at least 6 weeks prior to taking study treatment. In the case of oophorectomy alone, only when the reproductive status of the woman has been confirmed by follow-up levels of luteinizing hormone (LH), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), and/or estradiol.\n\nNon-hormonal intrauterine device used as directed by provider placing this is also acceptable.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Pre-existent peripheral neuropathy that is unrelated to chemotherapy\n* Pre-existent chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy greater than grade 2\n* Known metastases to the brain, spinal cord or peripheral nerves, or leptomeningeal disease\n* Concurrent administration of a poly (ADP-Ribose) polymerase inhibitor (e.g. olaparib, rucaparib)\n* Concurrent administration of a platinum-based chemotherapy\n* Diabetes requiring management by medication\n* Diabetes managed by medication\n* Neutrophils \\< 1,000 cells/m3\n* Hemoglobin \\< 8.0 g/dcl\n* Platelets \\< 100,000 cells/m3\n* Creatinine clearance \\< 30 ml/min\n* AST or ALT values \\> 2.5 X upper limits of normal\n* Total bilirubin \\> 2.0 X upper limits of normal\n* Heavy alcohol use defined at \\> 8 drinks/week by women or 12 drinks/week by men\n* Chronic pain greater than 3 months duration within the past year.\n* Severe psychiatric illness\n* Pregnancy\n* Current imprisonment\n* Limitations of self-expression, defined as an inability to answer questions posed by physicians, nurses, care-givers, or other members of the investigative team or an inability to describe somatosensations.\n* Known HIV, not on therapy\n* Regular use of nutritional supplements that contain nicotinamide or NIAGEN\u00ae within the previous 30 days\n* Use of duloxetine (Cymbalta\u00ae) within the previous 30 days\n* Pancreatic insufficiency requiring exocrine enzyme replacement therapy\n* GI conditions where malabsorption of B complex vitamins is known to occur.\n* Known allergy to Cremophor vehicle used to deliver paclitaxel in its Taxol formulation\n* Breastfeeding",
