Patients will be excluded if they have ever been diagnosed with cancer (including DCIS/LCIS) prior to the breast cancer for which the present course of AIs is being prescribed. However, patients will be eligible if they have a history of non-metastatic, non-melanomatous skin cancer\n* Metastatic (Stage IV) breast cancer, as their treatment and outcomes typically follow a different course\n* Bone fracture/surgery of an extremity during the preceding 6 months\n* Non-steroidal joint injection within the last 3 months.\n* Current use of corticosteroids, defined as oral, intravenous (IV), or injections of corticosteroids in the past 4 weeks\n* Regular use of narcotics.\n* Patients will be excluded due to the presence of the following psychiatric conditions: dementia, psychosis, current mania or uncontrolled major depressive disorder, or addictive disorder or current intoxication.\n* In the rare instance of the presence of a comorbidity that does not fall into any of the above mentioned exclusion criteria, but that is clinically determined to significantly interfere with the patient's ability to participate in the study (e.g., cognitive impairment)",
