If patient is on different glucocorticoid e.g., prednisone, must be converted to dexamethasone prior to enrollment. Refer to dose modification of everolimus for patients taking dexamethasone.\n* Interval \u22654 weeks between open brain biopsy and initiation of protocol-based therapy.\n* international normalized ratio (INR) \u22642.0. Anticoagulation is allowed if target INR \u22642.0 on a stable dose of warfarin or if patient on a stable dose of Low-molecular-weight (LMW) heparin for \\>1 weeks at time of enrollment.\n* Fasting serum cholesterol \u2264300 mg/dL OR \u22647.75 mmol/L AND fasting triglycerides \u22642.5 x ULN. Note: In case one or both of these thresholds are exceeded, the patient can only be included after initiation of appropriate lipid lowering medication.\n* Patients must have adequate organ function as evidenced by:\n* Absolute neutrophil count \u22651.5/\u00b5L\n* Platelet count \u2265100,000/\u00b5L\n* Hg \u22659 g/dL\n* Bilirubin \u22641.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN)\n* aspartate aminotransferase (AST) or Alanine transaminase (ALT) \u22642.5 x ULN (\u22645 x ULN if liver metastases are present)\n* Serum creatinine \u22641.5 x ULN\n* Archived, paraffin-embedded tissue block (primary or metastatic) available for genomic studies is required.\n* Signed, institutional review board (IRB)-approved written informed consent.\n\nExclusion Criteria\n\n* Patients who have received prior treatment with an mTOR inhibitor (e.g., sirolimus, temsirolimus, everolimus); patients who have received prior treatment with navelbine within prior 12 months.\n* patients with a known hypersensitivity to everolimus or other rapamycins (e.g. sirolimus, temsirolimus) or to its excipients.\n* Patients requiring treatment with any other systemic glucocorticoid. Note: This restriction regarding choice of glucocorticoid does not apply should patient need \\<2 week course of glucocorticoid for treatment of non-infectious pneumonitis during study (see section 4.5.2).\n* Patients with a known hypersensitivity to vinorelbine or to its excipients.\n* Prior allergic reaction to trastuzumab for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer.\n* Concurrent or planned radiation, hormonal, chemotherapeutic, experimental or targeted biologic therapy.\n* Peripheral neuropathy \u2265grade 3.\n* Evidence of frank hemorrhage or impending herniation on baseline brain imaging.

Close contact with those who have received attenuated live vaccines should be avoided during treatment with everolimus. Examples of live vaccines include intranasal influenza, measles, mumps, rubella, oral polio, Bacillus Calmette-Gu\u00e9rin (BCG), yellow fever, varicella, and Typhoid Vaccine Live Oral (TY21a) typhoid vaccines.\n* Other malignancies within the past 3 years except for adequately treated carcinoma of the cervix or basal or squamous cell carcinomas of the skin.\n* Patients who have any severe and/or uncontrolled medical conditions or other conditions that could affect their participation in the study such as:\n\n  * severely impaired lung function, defined as spirometry and diffusion lung capacity for carbon monoxide (DLCO) that is 50% of the normal predicted value and/or 02 saturation that is \u226488% at rest on room air\n  * uncontrolled diabetes, defined as fasting serum glucose \\>1.5 x ULN (Note: Optimal glycemic control should be achieved before starting trial therapy)\n  * active (acute or chronic) or uncontrolled severe infections\n  * liver disease such as cirrhosis or severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class C).\n\nNote: A detailed assessment of Hepatitis B/C medical history and risk factors must be done at screening for all patients. Hepatitis B Virus (HBV) DNA and hepatitis C Virus (HCV) RNA polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing are required at screening for all patients with a positive medical history based on risk factors and/or confirmation of prior HBV/HCV infection.\n\n* A known history of HIV seropositivity.\n* Impairment of gastrointestinal function or gastrointestinal disease that may significantly alter the absorption of everolimus (e.g., ulcerative disease, uncontrolled nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, malabsorption syndrome, or small bowel resection).\n* Patients with an active, bleeding diathesis or on oral anti-vitamin K medication (except low-dose warfarin and aspirin or equivalent, as long as the INR \u22642.0).\n* Unable or unwilling to discontinue use of prohibited fruit (or its juices) and prohibited medications listed in Appendices II and III for at least 14 days or 5 half-lives of a drug (whichever is longer) prior to the first dose of study drug and for the duration of the study.\n* Female patients who are pregnant or breastfeeding, or adults of reproductive potential who are not using effective birth control methods. Adequate contraception must be used throughout the trial and for 8 weeks after the last dose of study drug, by both sexes. Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) must have a negative urine or serum pregnancy test within 7 days prior to everolimus initiation.\n* Male patients whose sexual partner(s) are WOCBP who are not willing to use adequate contraception, during the study and for 8 weeks after the end of treatment\n* Contraindication to gadolinium-enhanced MRI imaging.\n* Inability to comply with study and/or follow-up procedures.\n* History of noncompliance to medical regimens.",
