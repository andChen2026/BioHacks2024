As intrafraction imaging is not common standard of care for brain, breast, head and neck and kidney cancer treatments there is no requirement to have intrafraction x-ray imaging data for these anatomical sites.\n* Provides written informed consent.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Less than 18 years of age",
