If IHC is 2+, a negative in situ hybridization (FISH, CISH, or SISH) test is required by local laboratory testing.\n* Patient must have either:\n\n  * Measurable disease, i.e., at least one measurable lesion as per RECIST 1.1 criteria or,\n  * At least one lytic bone lesion or . Non measurable disease\n* Patient has an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status \\<2\n* Patient has adequate bone marrow and organ function as defined by the following laboratory values:\n\n  * Absolute neutrophil count \u2265 1.5 \u00d7 109/L\n  * Platelets \u2265 100 \u00d7 109/L\n  * Hemoglobin \u2265 8.0 g/dL\n  * Normal calcium (corrected for serum albumin)\n  * Serum creatinine should be below 2 x ULN\n  * In absence of liver metastases, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) should be below 2.5 \u00d7 ULN. If the patient has liver metastases, ALT and AST should be \\< 5 \u00d7 ULN.\n  * Total serum bilirubin \\< ULN; or total bilirubin \u2264 3.0 \u00d7 ULN with direct bilirubin within normal range of the central laboratory in patients with well documented Gilbert's Syndrome\n* Life expectancy \\> 16 weeks\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Patient who received vinorelbine in adjuvant setting.\n* Patient with a known hypersensitivity to oral vinorelbine, l\u00e9trozole, Anastrozole or any of the excipients or others vinca-alcalo\u00efdes. 3. Patient who received any prior anti-cancer therapy (including chemotherapy) for advanced disease with the exception of surgery.\n\nNote:\n\n\u2022 Patients who received (neo) adjuvant therapy for breast cancer are eligible. Prior therapy with letrozole or anastrozole in the (neo) adjuvant setting is permitted if the disease free interval is greater than 24 months from the completion of treatment.\n\n* Patient has a concurrent malignancy or malignancy within 5 years of randomization, with the exception of adequately treated, basal or squamous cell carcinoma, non-melanomatous skin cancer or curatively resected cervix cancer.\n* Patient with known CNS metastases.\n* Patient with impairment of gastrointestinal (GI) function or GI disease that may significantly alter the absorption of the study drugs (e.g., ulcerative diseases, uncontrolled nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, malabsorption syndrome, or small bowel resection)\n* Patient with a known history of HIV infection (testing not mandatory)\n* Patient who any other concurrent severe and/or uncontrolled medical condition that would, in the investigator's judgment, contraindicate patient participation in the clinical study (e.g. chronic pancreatitis, chronic active hepatitis, etc.)\n* Patient with active cardiac disease or a history of cardiac dysfunction including any of the following:\n\nHistory of angina pectoris, symptomatic pericarditis, or myocardial infarction within 6 months prior to study entry History of documented congestive heart failure (New York Heart Association functional classification III-IV) Documented cardiomyopathy\n\n* Patient with peripheral neuropathy\\>grade 2 CTCAE version 4.0\n* Patient who had major surgery within 14 days prior to starting study drug or has not recovered from major side effects\n* Patient who concurrently using other antineoplastic agents.\n* Patient who has received radiotherapy for palliation \u2264 2 weeks prior to randomization, and who has not recovered to grade 1 or better from related side effects of such therapy (with the exception of alopecia) and/or from whom \u2265 30% of the bone marrow was irradiated.\n* Participation in another clinical trial with any investigational drug within 30 days prior to randomization and/or during the study.\n* Pregnancy or lactating patients\n* Patient with history of surgical resection extended to the stomach or small intestine\n* Patient with a severe infection current or recent (within 2 weeks)\n* Patient needs long-term oxygen therapy\n* Patient with rare hereditary problems of fructose intolerance\n* In combination with the vaccine against yellow fever",
