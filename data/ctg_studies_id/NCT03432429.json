However, the data for patients receiving NACT will be analysed separately as a pre-planned subgroup and these patients will not contribute data to the n=35 patients with positive margins required for this feasibility trial. Data from NACT cases have not been used to generate the validated multispectral database since eccentric fibrosis made the histological analysis more complex, which limited the number of patients in whom tissue was available for research.",
