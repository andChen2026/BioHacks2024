female patients of childbearing potential must agree to use two effective forms of non-hormonal contraception; effective methods of contraception include: intrauterine device (IUD); female condom; male condom; diaphragm with spermicide; cervical cap; or a sterile sexual partner; male patients with partners of childbearing potential must use barrier contraception; in addition, male patients should also have their partners use another method of contraception from the time of informed consent through the duration of study activity\n* Willingness and ability to comply with scheduled visits, treatment plans, laboratory tests, and other study procedures, including thrombokinetic studies and platelet function studies\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\nCANCER-RELATED CRITERIA\n\n* Known platelet disorder, such as von Willebrand's disease or baseline platelet count of \\< 100,000/mm\\^3\n* Chemotherapy =\\< 21 days before first study treatment\n* Trastuzumab =\\< 21 days before first study treatment\n* Lapatinib =\\< 14 days before first study treatment\n* Investigational therapy or any other therapy =\\< 28 days before first study treatment\n* Any prior ado-trastuzumab emtansine\n* Previous radiotherapy for the treatment of unresectable, locally advanced/recurrent or metastatic breast cancer is not allowed if:\n\n  * The last fraction of radiotherapy has been administered within 14 days of first on-study thormbokinetic study\n  * The patient has not recovered from any resulting acute toxicity (to grade =\\< 1) prior to first on-study thormbokinetic study\n* Brain metastases that are untreated or symptomatic, or require any radiation, surgery, or steroid therapy to control symptoms from brain metastases within 14 days of first on-study thrombokinetic study; for patients with newly diagnosed brain metastases or unequivocal progression of brain metastases on screening scans, localized treatment (i.e., surgery, radiosurgery, and/or whole brain radiotherapy) is required before study enrollment; subjects with known brain metastases must have clinically controlled neurologic symptoms, defined as surgical excision and/or radiation therapy followed by 14 days of stable neurologic function prior to the first thrombokinetic procedure; patients with small brain metastases not symptomatic and deemed requiring treatment by managing clinicians or study investigators may be permitted to enroll on study\n* History of intolerance (including grade 3 or 4 infusion reaction) or hypersensitivity to trastuzumab or murine proteins\n* Current peripheral neuropathy of grade \\>= 3 per the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE) v. 4.0\n* Current use of any platelet functioning inhibitors (including aspirin) within 14 days of first on-study thrombokinetic study\n\nCARDIOPULMONARY FUNCTION CRITERIA\n\n* Current unstable ventricular arrhythmia requiring treatment\n* History of symptomatic congestive heart failure (CHF) (New York Heart Association \\[NYHA\\] classes II-IV)\n* History of myocardial infarction or unstable angina within 6 months of enrollment\n* History of a decrease in LVEF to \\< 40% or symptomatic CHF with previous trastuzumab treatment\n* Severe dyspnea at rest due to complications of advanced malignancy or requiring current continuous oxygen therapy\n\nGENERAL CRITERIA\n\n* Current severe, uncontrolled non-cancer systemic disease (e.g., clinically significant cardiovascular, pulmonary, or metabolic disease) resulting in a life expectancy of \\< 6 months\n* Major surgical procedure or significant traumatic injury within 28 days before enrollment or anticipation of the need for major surgery during the course of study treatment\n* Current pregnancy or lactation\n* Current known active infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B, and/or hepatitis C virus; for patients who are known carriers of hepatitis B virus (HBV), active hepatitis B infection must be ruled out based on negative serologic testing and/or determination of HBV deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) viral load per local guidelines\n* Assessed by the investigator to be unable or unwilling to comply with the requirements of the protocol",
