However, use of corticosteroids is allowed for the treatment of immune related Adverse Events (irAEs), or adrenal insufficiency.\n  * Any non-oncology vaccine therapy used for prevention of infectious diseases within 4 weeks prior to first dose of ipilimumab.\n  * Prior treatment with a CD137 agonist, ipilimumab or other CTLA4 inhibitor;\n  * Prior investigational agents within 2 weeks prior to first dose of ipilimumab;\n  * Prior therapy with any anti-cancer agents including chemotherapy, adjuvant chemotherapy, immunosuppressive agents, surgery or radiotherapy within 2 weeks prior to first dose of ipilimumab.",
