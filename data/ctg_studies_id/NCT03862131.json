    "eligibilityCriteria": "Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Participant in the SURVIVE registry\n* Signed informed consent form for PROACT\n* Histological diagnosis of any cancer type (patients with treated and clinically stable brain metastasis are acceptable)\n* Scheduled to receive anti-cancer therapy (radiation therapy is permitted)\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Contraindication to magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)\n* Unable to comply with study investigations (in the judgment of the investigator)\n* Life expectancy less than 1 year\n* Note: If a patient develops a temporary contraindication (e.g. temporary tissue expanders in breast cancer patients) after the baseline MRI, follow up MRIs will be discontinued for safety for the duration in which the patient has the contraindication. However, once the patient is no longer contraindicated to receiving MRIs, the study schedule may resume with their next scheduled MRI time point from the date of enrollment. Therefore, some time points may be skipped during the patient's enrollment in the study.\n\nAlso, if a patient needs a repeat MRI at any time point for any reason (i.e. panic attack during the MRI causing them to not be able to continue, unreadable images, etc.), we may repeat the MRI as long as the patient is willing.",
