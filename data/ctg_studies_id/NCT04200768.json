Exceptions will be made for IBC patients, as in some cases no residual tumour will be found after neoadjuvant treatment;\n* be treatment na\u00efve, i.e. not having received systemic breast cancer treatment prior to surgery. An exception is made for the IBC patients, as they will often have received first line neoadjuvant chemotherapy before surgery. IBC patients that do not undergo surgery after neoadjuvant treatment (e.g. because of inoperability of the patient) will not be included;\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* pregnancy at time of diagnosis;\n* personal history of breast cancer (relapse/second primary);\n* mixed invasive tumour type on core biopsy or special type of breast carcinoma beside pure ILC;\n* history of an additional malignancy that is progressing or that has required active treatment in the 5 years prior to breast cancer diagnosis. Exceptions include basal cell carcinoma of the skin or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin that have undergone potentially curative therapy or in situ cervical cancer;\n* presence of an immune dysregulatory disease or condition which requires active immune modulatory treatment of any kind, or has required treatment in the past two years. Replacement therapy (e.g., thyroxine, insulin, or physiologic corticosteroid replacement therapy for adrenal or pituitary insufficiency, etc.) is not considered a form of systemic treatment;\n* history or current evidence of any condition, therapy, or laboratory abnormality that might confound the results of the trial in the opinion of the treating investigator.",
