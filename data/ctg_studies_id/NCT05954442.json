Blood routine examination standards should meet: HB\u226590g/L (no blood transfusion within 14 days); ANC\u22651.5\u00d7109/L; PLT\u226575\u00d7109/L;\n    2. Biochemical examination shall meet the following standards: TBIL\u22641.5\u00d7 upper limit of normal value(ULN); alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and AST\u22643 x ULN; In case of liver metastasis, ALT and AST\u22645\u00d7ULN; Serum Cr \u22641\u00d7ULN, endogenous creatinine clearance \\> 50ml/min (Cockcroft-Gault formula);\n  * Patients have not received radiotherapy, endocrine therapy, molecular targeted therapy, or surgery within 3 weeks prior to study initiation, and have recovered from acute toxic effects of prior treatment (if surgery is present, the wound has fully healed); No peripheral neuropathy or grade I peripheral neurotoxicity;\n  * Fertile female are required to use a medically approved contraceptive during study treatment and for at least 3 months after the last use of the study drug;\n  * Patients voluntarily join the study, sign the informed consent, have good compliance, and cooperate with follow-up.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Patients with any of the following conditions were excluded from the study:\n\n  * Patients with known central nervous system metastasis or history of central nervous system metastasis prior to screening. For patients with clinically suspected central nervous system metastasis, enhanced CT or enhanced MRI must be performed within 28 days before the first dose to rule out central nervous system metastasis.\n  * A history of clinically significant or uncontrolled heart disease, including congestive heart failure, angina pectoris, myocardial infarction within the last 6 months, or ventricular arrhythmia;\n  * Persistent grade \u22651 adverse events due to previous treatment. The exception to this is hair loss or something the researchers believe should not be ruled out.
