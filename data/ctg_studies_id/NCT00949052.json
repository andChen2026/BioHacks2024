    "eligibilityCriteria": "Inclusion Criteria:\n\nCASES are those who:\n\n* Survived at least 100 days post-hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT).\n* Developed an SMN after that time point.\n* And received TBI as part of the preparative regimen.\n\nCONTROLS are randomly selected:\n\n* In a 4:1 ratio to cases from the same cohort of 100 day + survivors of HSCT who received TBI.\n* Controls will be matched to the cases by race and primary diagnosis.\n* In addition, they must have survived for at least the elapsed time between the case's HSCT and the secondary cancer, without development of an SMN.\n* We are matching on primary diagnosis, as genotype or radiation sensitivity may predispose to specific primary cancers, as well as the SMNs.\n* We are matching on race, as allele frequencies vary widely across ethnic groups.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Did not survive at least 100 days post-hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT).\n* Did not develop an SMN after that time point.\n* Did not receive TBI as part of the preparative regimen.",
