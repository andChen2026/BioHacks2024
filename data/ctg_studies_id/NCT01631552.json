Individuals with a mass over 7 cm, but otherwise eligible, may be considered for enrollment after discussion and approval with the medical monitor.\n* Individuals with active \u2265 grade 2 anorexia, nausea or vomiting, and/or signs of intestinal obstruction.\n* Individuals with non-melanoma skin cancer or carcinoma in situ of the cervix are eligible, while individuals with other prior malignancies must have had at least a 3-year disease-free interval.\n* Individuals known to be HIV positive, hepatitis B positive, or hepatitis C positive.\n* Known history of unstable angina, MI, or CHF present within 6 months or clinically significant cardiac arrhythmia (other than stable atrial fibrillation) requiring anti-arrhythmia therapy.\n* Known history of clinically significant active COPD, or other moderate-to-severe chronic respiratory illness present within 6 months.\n* Prior history of clinically significant bleeding, intestinal obstruction, or GI perforation within 6 months of initiation of study treatment.\n* Infection requiring intravenous antibiotic use within 1 week.\n* History of an anaphylactic reaction to irinotecan or \u2265 Grade 3 GI toxicity to prior irinotecan,\n* Other concurrent medical or psychiatric conditions that, in the Investigator's opinion, may be likely to confound study interpretation or prevent completion of study procedures and follow-up examinations.",
