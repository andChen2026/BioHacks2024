Subject agrees to collect tumor biopsy specimen during the screening period;\n6. Subject signed the informed consent form, expressing willingness and ability to comply with the planned visits, study treatments, laboratory tests, and other trial procedures.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n1. Coexisted with other malignant tumors within 5 years prior to first medication, except for cured squamous cell carcinoma of the skin, basal cell carcinoma, non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer, carcinoma in situ of the cervix/breast, etc;\n2. Had a serious infection within 1 month before screening or required systemic treatment for any active infection within 2 weeks before first medication;\n3.

History of organ transplantation or allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation;\n5. Patients who received systemic anti-cancer treatment within 2 weeks before the first dose, including chemotherapy, immunotherapy, hormone therapy, biological therapy (cytokines or growth factors that control the progression of cancer);\n6.
