Bullets, shrapnel, metalwork fragments, or other metallic material adds unnecessary risk to the patient\n  * Implanted medical device not described above that is not MRI-compatible\n  * Known history of claustrophobia\n  * Contrast contraindications not included since patients will not be receiving MRI or CT contrast as part of this study",
