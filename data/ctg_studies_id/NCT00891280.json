Patients with known liver metastases or liver neoplasms: alanine aminotransferase (ALT) or aspartate aminotransferase (AST) \\< 5.0 X ULN\n* Renal: serum creatinine within normal limits (WNL), defined as within 10% of the institution's stated reference range, or a calculated creatinine clearance \\>60 mL/min/1.73 m2 for patients with abnormal, increased, creatinine levels. Patients with Multiple Myeloma (only): serum creatinine \u2264 2.5 the institutional upper limit of the normal range and a calculated creatinine clearance \\> 40 mL/min/1.73 m2.\n* Coagulation: INR \\< 1.5 times normal, aPTT \\< 1.5 times normal. Patients receiving therapeutic doses of anticoagulant therapy may be considered eligible for the trial if INR and aPTT are within the acceptable therapeutic limits for the institution.\n* A negative pregnancy test (if female of childbearing potential).\n* Estimated life expectancy of at least 3 months\n* Karnofsky Performance Status \u2265 70%\n* For men and women of child-producing potential, use of effective contraceptive methods during the study\n* Ability to understand the requirements of the study, provide written informed consent.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Pregnant or nursing women.\n* Seizure disorders requiring anticonvulsant therapy.\n* Known brain metastases (unless previously treated and well controlled for a period of \\> or = 3 months).\n* Major surgery, other than diagnostic surgery, within 4 weeks prior to the first dose of test drug.\n* Treatment with radiation therapy or surgery within one month prior to study entry\n* Treatment with chemotherapy or investigational drugs within 21 days prior to the screening visit. Acute toxicities from prior therapy must have resolved to Grade \u2264 1 above baseline.\n* Patients with a history of a second malignancy within 3 years of the baseline visit excluding cutaneous carcinomas and in-situ carcinoma.\n* Concurrent severe or uncontrolled medical disease.\n* Active symptomatic fungal, bacterial and/or viral infection including active HIV or viral hepatitis.\n* Difficulty with swallowing or an active malabsorption syndrome\n* Chronic diarrhea\n* Gastrointestinal diseases including gastritis, ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease, or hemorrhagic coloproctitis\n* History of gastric or small bowel surgery involving any extent of gastric or small bowel resection.\n* Clinically significant bleeding event within the last 3 months, unrelated to trauma, or underlying condition that would be expected to result in a bleeding diathesis\n* Patients who have exhibited allergic reactions to a similar structural compound or to a formulation component.\n* Concomitant use of warfarin and HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins)",
