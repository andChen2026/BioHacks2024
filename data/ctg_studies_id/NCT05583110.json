Other severe acute or chronic medical (such as neuropathy grade 3-4) or psychiatric condition or laboratory abnormality that may increase the risk associated with study participation or study treatment administration or may interfere with the interpretation of study results and, in the judgment of the investigator, would make the patient inappropriate for entry into this study.\n14. Are pregnant, breastfeeding, or planning a pregnancy. Women of child-bearing potential or partners of women of child-bearing potential, unless agreement to remain abstinent or use of single or combined non-hormonal contraceptive methods that result in a failure rate of \\< 1% per year during the treatment period and for at least 7 months after the last dose of study treatment.\n\n    1. Abstinence is only acceptable if it is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the patient. Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, or post-ovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception.\n    2. Examples of non-hormonal contraceptive methods with a failure rate of \\< 1% per year include tubal ligation, male sterilization (only if he is the sole partner and have been performed at least 6 months prior to screening), and certain intrauterine devices.\n    3.
