    "eligibilityCriteria": "CORE PHASE Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Patient has an advanced (locoregionally recurrent or metastatic) breast cancer in first line treatment (treatment na\u00efve for the advanced setting).\n* Patient is in post-menopause, defined by one of the following:\n* Prior bilateral oophorectomy\n* Age \u226560\n* Age \\<60 and amenorrhea for 12 or more months (in the absence of chemotherapy, tamoxifen, toremifen, or ovarian suppression) and FSH and estradiol in the postmenopausal range per local normal range\n* Patient has a histologically and/or cytologically confirmed diagnosis of estrogenreceptor positive and/or progesterone receptor positive breast cancer by local laboratory.\n* Patient has an HER2-negative breast cancer defined as a negative in situ hybridization test or an IHC status of 0, 1+ or 2+. If IHC is 2+, a negative in situ hybridization (FISH, CISH, or SISH) test is required by local laboratory testing.\n* Patient is willing to undergo blood and tumor sample collection for the biological assessments/objectives as scheduled in the protocol.\n\nCORE PHASE Exclusion Criteria:\n\n* Patient who received prior treatment with any CDK4/6 inhibitor.\n* Patient who received any prior systemic hormonal therapy or chemotherapy for advanced breast cancer.\n\nNote:\n\nPatients who received neo/adjuvant therapy for breast cancer are eligible. If the prior neo/adjuvant therapy included letrozole or anastrozole, the disease-free interval must be greater than 12 months from the completion of treatment until study entry.\n\n\u2022 Patients who received \u2264 28 days of letrozole or anastrozole for advanced disease prior to inclusion in this trial are eligible.\n\n- Patient is currently using other anti-cancer therapy. Other protocol-defined inclusion/exclusion criteria may apply.\n\nEXTENSION PHASE Inclusion criteria:\n\n* Patient has been discontinued (any reason allowed) from treatment with ribociclib + letrozole in the core phase and is deemed suitable for treatment with alpelisib + fulvestrant in second line. Ribociclib + letrozole must be the last treatment regimen before alpelisib + fulvestrant.\n* Patient has PIK3CA mutation as determined in tumor tissue and/or plasma by a Novartis designated laboratory. Results of tissue samples obtained during the core phase (screening or EOT) are acceptable\n\nEXTENSION PHASE Exclusion criteria:\n\n* Patient has received prior treatment with any PI3K inhibitors.\n* Patient is concurrently using other anti-cancer therapy. Ribociclib and letrozole used in the core phase must be discontinued at least 7 days prior to day one of the extension study treatment.\n\nAll drugs with overlapping toxicities must be discontinued within 7 days and AE resolved to NCI CTCAE v4.03 Grade \u22641 prior to study treatment. Exception to this criterion: patients with any grade of alopecia are allowed to enter the study.",
