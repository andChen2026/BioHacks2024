Patients with high-risk early-stage BC according to at least one of the following criteria:\n\n   1. If no previous neoadjuvant chemotherapy:\n\n   i. pN2/N3 or ii. pN1,\n\n1. pT3/T4 and/or 2. high genomic risk defined as Oncotype Dx Recurrence Score \\> 25 if post-menopausal; \\> 20 if pre-menopausal , Prosigna score \u2265 41, Mammaprint high risk category or similar and/or 3. histological grade II/III and Ki67\\>20%. b.
