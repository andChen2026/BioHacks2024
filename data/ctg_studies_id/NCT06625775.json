Only 1 prior line is acceptable where there is no other regionally available standard of care (SoC).\n* Patients with HR-positive, HER2-negative aBC, KRAS mutant aCRC or aNSCLC: Must have progression on, or disease recurrence after, all available SoC treatments or in the opinion of the investigator, would be unlikely to tolerate or derive clinically meaningful benefit from appropriate SoC therapy.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Patients with HER2+ aBC who have had more than 1 prior line of therapy with an antibody-drug conjugate\n* Patients with KRAS mutant aCRC who have BRAFV600E mutation, HER2amp, or dMMR/MSI-H tumors\n* Patients with KRAS mutant aNSCLC who have tumors with other targetable driver mutations (eg, EGFR, anaplastic lymphoma kinase, ROS1/BRAF/RET/MET/EGFR exon20 insertion/NTRK/HER2)\n* Patients with untreated brain metastases (exceptions apply for HER2+ aBC per protocol)\n\nOther inclusion/exclusion criteria are specified in the protocol",
