Ascites, pleural effusion, and bone metastases are not considered measurable;\n* Acceptance of pre-treatment metastatic biopsies for all patients and on-treatment metastatic biopsies in selected centres.\n\nFor the whole study:\n\n* Male or female subjects aged \u2265 18 years old, or legal age of the majority in the country;\n* Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1;\n* Estimated life expectancy of at least 3 months;\n* Adequate haematological function based on the last assessment performed within 7 days prior to the first IMP (investigational medicinal product) administration;\n* Adequate renal function based on the last assessment performed within 7 days prior to the first IMP administration;\n* Adequate hepatic function based on the last assessment performed within 7 days prior to the first IMP administration;\n* Female participant of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test (serum) within 7 days prior to the first day of test drug administration. Effective contraception both for female patients of childbearing potential and male patients with parteners of childbearing potential.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Other active malignancy within the last 3 years (except for basal cell carcinoma or a non-invasive/in situ cervical cancer or intra-mucosal gastro-intestinal cancers that were treated curatively);\n* Presence of grade \u2265 2 toxic effects (excluding alopecia) due to prior cancer therapy;\n* Known hypersensitivity to the IMP (S 81694 and paclitaxel) or their excipients;\n* Evidence of peripheral neuropathy of grade 2 or higher;\n* Participant previously received paclitaxel and discontinued due to toxicity related to paclitaxel;\n* Participant known as refractory to taxanes;\n* Any prior cancer therapy within 4 weeks or 5 half-life (whichever is the shorter) before the first IMP administration;\n* Participant with current, serious, uncontrolled infections;\n* Participant with brain metastasis or leptomeningeal metastasis (except patients with brain metastasis that have been stable post-radiation therapy and who are off steroids for \\> 2 months);\n* History of cardiac disease;\n* Uncontrolled arterial hypertension;\n* Presence of risk factors for torsades de pointes (e.g. heart failure, hypokalaemia, family history of long QT syndrome);\n* Any clinically significant medical condition (e.g. organ dysfunction) or laboratory abnormality likely to jeopardize the patient's safety or to interfere with the conduct of the study, in the investigator's opinion.",
