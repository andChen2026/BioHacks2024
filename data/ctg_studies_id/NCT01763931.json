Note: Patients already receiving digoxin are also excluded.\n* Presence of any of the following on electrocardiogram (ECG): atrial arrhythmias, including atrial fibrillation and flutter; AV block; heart rate \\< 60 beats/minute and \\> 100 beats/minute; ventricular Fibrillation; ventricular tachycardia; premature ventricular contractions; Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome. Note: Any questions on cardiac eligibility should be reviewed by the Study Cardiologist for approval in advance of enrollment.\n* History of any of the following, unless approval is given by the Protocol Chair: heart disease, including acute myocardial infarction; cardiac arrhythmias, including sick sinus syndrome; pulmonary disease with a known forced expiratory volume (FEV) of \\<1.5 or on oxygen; gastrointestinal disease, surgery or malabsorption that could potentially impact the absorption of the study drug; patients requiring the use of a feeding tube; inability to swallow tablets\n* Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that will limit compliance with study requirements\n* Any medical condition which in the opinion of the investigator puts the patient at risk of potentially serious complications while on this therapy",
