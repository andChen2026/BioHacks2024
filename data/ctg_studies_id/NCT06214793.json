Females without menses for at least 1 year prior to screening or documented to be surgically sterilized. Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) must agree to use one highly effective method of contraception or agree with complete abstinence from sexual intercourse since the informed consent until 45 days after the last dose of investigational drug.\n12.
