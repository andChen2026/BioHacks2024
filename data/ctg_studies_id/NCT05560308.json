Patients who have previously used ADCs to treat advanced breast cancer\n2. Symptomatic patients with brain metastases\n3. Control unstable pleural effusion and ascites patients\n4. Patients with previous or concurrent malignancies whose natural medical history or treatment may interfere with the safety or efficacy assessment of the study protocol are not eligible to participate in this trial, except for basal cell or squamous cell skin cancer, cervical cancer in situ, or bladder cancer , or the subject has lived free of disease (other cancers) for at least 5 years.\n5. Active infection requiring systemic treatment\n6. Gastrointestinal dysfunction or disease that may seriously affect the absorption of the study drug (such as ulcerative disease, uncontrolled nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, malabsorption syndrome or small bowel resection) or severely impair the ability to swallow capsules/tablets\n7.
