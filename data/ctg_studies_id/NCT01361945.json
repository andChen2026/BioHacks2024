All patients should have documented clinical progression prior to entering study\n* Prior chemotherapy for metastatic stage IV disease is prohibited for patients enrolled in phase II, but allowed up to 3 lines for patients enrolled in Phase I. Prior neoadjuvant/adjuvant chemotherapy, antiestrogens, and radiotherapy are allowed.
