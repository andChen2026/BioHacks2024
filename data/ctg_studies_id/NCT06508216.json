    "eligibilityCriteria": "Inclusion Criteria:\n\n1. Male or female patients (who are \u226518 years of age at the time of signing the informed consent) who have a pathologically documented breast cancer that is:\n\n   * Advanced/unresectable (patients who can be treated with curative intent are not eligible) or metastatic.\n   * HER2-negative (IHC 0, 1+ or IHC 2+/ISH-) based on local assessment according to ASCO/CAP guidelines 1.\n   * Documented as hormone receptor-negative (both oestrogen receptors and progesterone receptors are negative \\[oestrogen receptors and progesterone receptors \\< 10%\\]) as per GEFPICS guidelines in the metastatic setting 2.\n2. Patients need to provide an adequate tissue sample: provided from either a new biopsy of a metastatic site or the most recent archival biopsy taken at the time of diagnosis of metastatic disease, if performed within 1 month of the ICF signature. Additionally, an archival sample of the primary tumor may be submitted (if available) in addition to any recent archival tissue provided.\n3. Patients who have early relapsed triple negative breast cancer i.e.:\n\n   * Patients who have received neo/adjuvant chemotherapy in the localized stage.\n   * Radiological and anatomopathological evidence of disease recurrence or metastasis while on (neo)adjuvant treatment or within 12 months from the end of all treatments with curative intent.\n4.

An adequate treatment washout period before randomization/enrolment.\n10. Patients with leptomeningeal or brain metastases can be included in the trial if symptoms are controlled with corticosteroids until 10 mg/day of prednisone or equivalent. Patients with brain metastases must receive radiotherapy if indicated, before study entry. Anticonvulsant therapy must be stable for at least 14 days prior to C1D1.\n\n    Reproduction\n11. Evidence of post-menopausal status or negative serum pregnancy test for females of child-bearing potential who are sexually active with a non-sterilized male partner.\n\n    For women of child-bearing potential, a negative result for a pregnancy test (A negative serum pregnancy test at screening visit and a negative serum or urine pregnancy test within 72 hours prior to first study treatment administration).\n\n    Women will be considered post-menopausal if they have been amenorrhoeic for at least 12 months without an alternative medical cause. The following age-specific requirements apply:\n    * Women \\< 50 years of age would be considered post-menopausal if they have been amenorrhoeic for 12 months or more following cessation of exogenous hormonal treatments and if they have luteinizing hormone and follicle-stimulating hormone levels in the post-menopausal range for the institution.\n    * Women \u2265 50 years of age would be considered post-menopausal if they have been amenorrhoeic for 12 months or more following cessation of all exogenous hormonal treatments, had radiation-induced menopause with last menses\\> 1 year ago, had chemotherapy-induced menopause with last menses \\> 1 year ago).\n12. Women who are surgically sterile (i.e., bilateral salpingectomy, bilateral oophorectomy, or complete hysterectomy) are eligible.\n13. Female patients of child-bearing potential who are sexually active with a non-sterilized male partner must use at least one highly effective method of contraception from the time of screening and must agree to continue using such precautions for 7 months after the last dose of study treatment. Not all methods of contraception are highly effective. Female patients must refrain from egg cell donation and breastfeeding while on study and for 7 months after the last dose of study treatment. Not engaging in sexual activity for the duration of the study and drug washout period is an acceptable practice; however, periodic, or occasional abstinence, the rhythm method, and the withdrawal method are not acceptable methods of contraception.\n14. Non-sterilized male patients who are sexually active with a female partner of child-bearing potential must use a condom with spermicide from screening to 4 months after the final dose of study treatment. Not engaging in sexual activity for the duration of the study and drug washout period is an acceptable practice; however, periodic, or occasional abstinence, the rhythm method, and the withdrawal method are not acceptable methods of contraception. It is strongly recommended for the female partners of a male patient to also use at least one highly effective method of contraception throughout this period. In addition, male patients should refrain from fathering a child or donating sperm during the study and for 4 months after the last dose of study treatment. Preservation of sperm should be considered prior to enrollment in this study.\n15. Female patients must not donate, or retrieve for their own use, ova from the time of screening and throughout the study treatment period, and for at least 7 months after the final study treatment administration. Preservation of ova should be considered prior to enrollment in this study Informed Consent\n16.

Uncontrolled intercurrent illness, including but not limited to, ongoing or active infection, uncontrolled or significant cardiovascular disease, severe pulmonary function compromise, serious chronic gastrointestinal conditions associated with diarrhea, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements, substantially increase risk of incurring AEs or compromise the ability of the patient to give written informed consent.\n3. Has a clinically significant corneal disease.\n4. Has a history of non-infectious ILD/pneumonitis including radiation pneumonitis that required steroids, has current ILD/pneumonitis, or has suspected ILD/pneumonitis that cannot be ruled out by imaging at screening.\n5.
