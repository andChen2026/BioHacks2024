Histologically or cytologically confirmed recurrent locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer not amenable to treatment with curative intent, and the following cohort specific criteria:\n\n   A. Cohort 1\n   * HR+ HER2- breast cancer harboring an FGFR2 gene amplification.\n   * Measurable disease per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) Version 1.1\n   * Has received 1-3 prior endocrine-containing therapies and up to 2 prior chemotherapy regimens for advanced/metastatic disease\n   * Has received prior treatment with a CDK4/6 inhibitor or is ineligible for such treatment\n\n   B. Cohort 2\n   * TNBC harboring an FGFR2 gene amplification\n   * Measurable disease per RECIST 1.1\n   * Has received at least 1 prior chemotherapy or chemotherapy/immunotherapy (PD-L1/PD-1 inhibitors) regimen for advanced/metastatic disease\n\n   C.

Prior treatment with fulvestrant is not permitted.\n   * Has received prior treatment with a CDK4/6 inhibitor or is ineligible for such treatment\n   * Pre/peri-menopausal patients must be on goserelin\n4.

History and/or current evidence of any of the following disorders:\n\n   1. Non-tumor related alteration of the calcium-phosphorus homeostasis that is considered clinically significant\n   2. Ectopic mineralization/calcification, including but not limited to soft tissue, kidneys, intestine, or myocardia and lung, considered clinically significant\n   3. Retinal or corneal disorder confirmed by retinal/corneal examination and considered clinically significant\n2. Prior treatment with an FGFR inhibitor\n3. A serious illness or medical condition(s)\n4. Brain metastases that are untreated or clinically or radiologically unstable\n5. Pregnant or lactating female",
