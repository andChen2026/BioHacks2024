Stable patients post-treatment with no evidence of progression may be eligible if steroid-free for at least 14 days;\n* History of allogeneic organ or hematopoietic stem cell transplantation;\n* Abnormal laboratory parameters:\n\n  1. Serum phosphate \\> 1.5 x ULN;\n  2. Elevated serum calcium or albumin-adjusted calcium outside the reference range;\n* Known HIV infection or positive HIV test;\n* Active or poorly controlled serious infection;\n* Need for drainage treatment for pleural effusion, ascites, or pericardial effusion;\n* Active hepatitis B or C infection with high viral load, or positive HBsAg or anti-HCV antibodies. Patients on antiviral therapy must meet lower thresholds;\n* Significant uncontrolled heart disease, including recent MI, severe heart failure, or uncontrolled arrhythmias;\n* Clinically significant ECG changes or history of significant cardiac issues; Screening QTcF interval \\> 480 ms, or JTc interval if applicable, must be \u2264 340 ms;\n* Uncontrolled hypertension despite treatment;\n* Hepatic encephalopathy, hepatorenal syndrome, or Child-Pugh grade B or higher cirrhosis;\n* Major surgery within 4 weeks before the first dose or planned major surgery during the study;\n* Unresolved complications from prior surgery;\n* Pregnant or breastfeeding women, or those planning to become pregnant during the study period and for safety follow-up;\n* Radiotherapy within 4 weeks before the first dose, except for non-CNS palliative radiotherapy with a 2-week washout period;\n* History of systemic electrolyte imbalance or ectopic soft tissue calcification;\n* Clinically significant corneal or retinal disease;\n* Use of potent CYP3A4 inhibitors or inducers within 14 days or 5 half-lives before the first dose;",
