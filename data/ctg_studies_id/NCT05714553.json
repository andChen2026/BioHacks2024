Ability to comply with protocol requirements.\n13. Female patients of child-bearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test within 7 days prior to the first study drug administration. This criterion does not apply to patients who have had a previous hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy. Male patients and female patients of child-bearing potential must agree to practice true abstinence or to use two forms of contraception, one of which must be highly effective. These forms of contraception must be used from the time of signing consent, throughout the treatment period, and for 6 months following the last dose of any study medication. Oral or injectable contraceptive agents cannot be the sole method of contraception.\n14.

Patient must be willing to undergo a new tumour biopsy at Screening and during therapy on the study. Biopsies are mandatory for patient inclusion, except where taking a biopsy would be associated with unacceptable clinical risk due to the location of the disease. A prior (archival) biopsy that is less than 6 months old (from the date of Cycle 1Day 1; C1D1) may be substituted for a fresh tumour biopsy at Screening.\n4.

History of hypersensitivity or current contra-indications to 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), floxuridine (FUDR), capecitabine (refer to latest package inserts), or the components of the NUC-3373 drug product formulation (super refined polysorbate 80 \\[SRP80\\], dimethylacetamide \\[DMA\\]).\n2. Symptomatic central nervous system or leptomeningeal metastases.\n3. Symptomatic ascites, ascites currently requiring drainage procedures or ascites requiring drainage over the 3 months prior to date of first dose of study drug.\n4. Chemotherapy, hormonal therapy, radiotherapy (other than a short cycle of palliative radiotherapy, e.g., for bone pain\\*), immunotherapy, biological agents, or exposure to another investigational agent within 21 days (or four times the half-life for molecular targeted agents, whichever is shorter) of first administration of study treatment:\n\n   1.

Corticosteroid treatment is allowed during screening but should be weaned to a dose of 10 mg prednisolone (or steroid equivalent) by Cycle 1 Day 1 \\* Palliative radiotherapy during participation in the study is permitted, but should not be concurrent with study treatment and recovery should be allowed to prevent overlapping toxicity. It should not include a target lesion.\n5. Residual toxicities from prior chemotherapy, immunotherapy or radiotherapy which have not regressed to Grade \u22641 severity (Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v5.0), except for alopecia, peripheral neuropathy and ototoxicity (which are excluded if \u2265Grade 3).\n6. Uncontrolled concurrent cancer other than the indication under investigation. Patients with a concurrent cancer whose natural history or treatment does not have the potential to interfere with safety or efficacy assessment are eligible.\n7. Presence of an active bacterial or viral infection (including severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV- 2), Herpes Zoster or chicken pox), or known active hepatitis B or C.\n8. Presence of any uncontrolled concurrent serious illness, medical condition or other medical history, including laboratory results, which, in the Investigator's opinion, would be likely to interfere with the patient's ability to participate in the study or with the interpretation of the results, including any of the following:\n\n   1.
