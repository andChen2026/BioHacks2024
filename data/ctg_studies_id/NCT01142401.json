the interval between the first fulvestrant dose and registration must be 6 weeks or less; patients may have received EITHER 250 mg or 500 mg of fulvestrant previously; if the patient has received 250 mg, they will receive the 500 mg loading dose on study day -14;

abstinence) prior to study entry and for the duration of study participation; should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately\n* ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA FOR ARM C\n* Previously met all eligibility criteria for arms A and B and registered on trial to arm A (fulvestrant alone)\n* Disease progression on arm A and agreeable to crossover to arm C\n* Has received no intervening therapy (ie, alternative endocrine therapy, chemotherapy, biologic therapy) between disease progression on arm A and registration an arm C\n* ECOG performance status 0-2\n* Tumor measurements (eg, computed tomography \\[CT\\] scan of chest/abdomen/pelvis) within 4 weeks of registration to arm C\n* Leukocytes \\>= 3,000/mcL, within 2 weeks of registration on arm C\n* Absolute neutrophil count \\>= 1,500/mcL, within 2 weeks of registration on arm C\n* Platelets \\>= 100,000/mcL, within 2 weeks of registration on arm C\n* Total bilirubin within normal institutional limits, within 2 weeks of registration on arm C\n* AST(SGOT)/ALT(SGPT) =\\< 2.5 x institutional upper limit of normal, within 2 weeks of registration on arm C\n* Creatinine within normal institutional limits, within 2 weeks of registration on arm C OR creatinine clearance \\>= 60 mL/min/1.73 m\\^2 for patients with creatinine levels above institutional normal, within 2 weeks of registration on arm C\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* EXCLUSION CRITERIA FOR ARM A AND ARM B\n* Patients who have had chemotherapy or radiotherapy within 4 weeks (6 weeks for nitrosoureas or mitomycin C) prior to entering the study or those who have not recovered from adverse events due to agents administered more than 4 weeks earlier\n* Patients may not be receiving any other investigational agents\n* Patients with known brain metastases should be excluded from this clinical trial\n* Presence of rapidly progressive, life-threatening metastases; this includes patients with extensive hepatic involvement (\\> 50% of the liver involved), symptomatic lymphangitic metastases, or brain or leptomeningeal involvement\n* History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic composition to bortezomib or fulvestrant\n* Patients who are concomitantly receiving bortezomib and drugs that are inhibitors or inducers of cytochrome P450 3A4 should be closely monitored for either toxicities or reduced efficacy\n* Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements\n* Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive patients on combination antiretroviral therapy are ineligible\n* Patients who have previously received fulvestrant\n* Patients who have previously received bortezomib\n* Concomitant anticancer treatment with the following exceptions: (1) bisphosphonates for bone metastases, (2) a GnRH analog is permitted if the patient had progressive disease on a GnRH analog plus a selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs) or an AI;
