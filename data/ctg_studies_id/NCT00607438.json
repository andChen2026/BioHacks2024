Patients with \\> Grade 2 peripheral neuropathy (NCI-CTC v3.0) or any painful neuropathy.\n18. Patients who have experienced any type of bone fracture within 12 months or who have undergone joint replacement surgery within 6 months.\n19. Patients with a serious non-healing wound.\n20. Patients with known human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection or chronic Hepatitis B or C.\n21.
