Male or female, aged 18 to 75 years (including boundary value);\n3. Unresectable locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer confirmed by histology or cytology, ER, PR, HER-2 are all negative. Negative ER and PR were defined as: IHCER \\< 1%, IHCPR \\< 1%. HER-2 negative is defined as: IHCHER-2 (-) or (1+), HER-2 (2+) must be tested by FISH and the result is negative.\n4. Patients who have not received systemic treatment for advanced TNBC in the past are allowed to use taxane anti-tumor therapy in the previous neoadjuvant and/or adjuvant treatment stage, but must meet the end time of taxane neoadjuvant and/or adjuvant treatment Recurrence/metastasis interval \u2265 12 months;\n5. Sufficient organ function;\n6. The Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) score of physical status is 0-1;\n7. Expected survival period \u2265 12 weeks;\n8. According to the RECIST1.1 standard, the subject has at least one measurable tumor lesion.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n1. History of severe allergic diseases, allergic history of serious drugs (including unlisted test drugs) or known allergic to any component of this test drug;\n2. Previously received any antibody or inhibitor therapy targeting PD-1/PD-L1 or VEGF;\n3. There is meningeal metastasis, uncontrollable or symptomatic central nervous system (CNS) metastasis;\n4. Those who have active infection and currently need intravenous anti-infection treatment;\n5. At present, there are uncontrollable pleural effusion, pericardium effusion and abdominal effusion;\n6. Before the start of the study and treatment, fever of unknown cause \\> 38.5\u00b0C (according to the researcher's judgment, fever caused by tumor can be included in the group);\n7. Known history of allogeneic organ transplantation or allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation;\n8. Known history of alcohol abuse, psychotropic substance abuse or drug abuse;\n9. Have a clear history of neurological or mental disorders, such as epilepsy, dementia and schizophrenia;\n10. Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection or known acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS);\n11. Syphilis nonspecific antibody test is positive (such as TRUST and PRP) or syphilis specific antibody test is positive (such as TPPA) \\[it is acceptable that \"Syphilis specific antibody test\" is positive but \"Syphilis nonspecific antibody test\" is negative for more than one year\\];\n12. Active tuberculosis, or a history of tuberculosis infection in the past but failed to control after treatment;\n13. Active hepatitis B (HBsAg positive and HBV-DNA \u22651 1000 IU/ml) can be controlled by antiviral drugs (HBV-DNA \\< 1000 IU/ml). Active hepatitis C (HCV-RNA \\> detection limit of research center);\n14. According to the researcher's judgment, the subject's basic illness may increase the risk of receiving the study drug, or confuse the explanation of the toxic reaction and AE;\n15. It is expected that any other form of anti-tumor drug treatment will be required during the study;\n16. Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding.",
