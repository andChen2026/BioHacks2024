Patient has HER2-negative breast cancer defined as\n* a negative in-situ hybridization test or an IHC status of 0, 1+, or 2+,\n* if IHC is 2+, a negative in-situ hybridization (FISH, CISH, or SISH) test is required (based on the analyzed tissue sample at initial diagnosis by a local laboratory).\n\n  7. Patients are eligible\n* with completed (i.e., 5 years according to SoC), planned or ongoing adjuvant endocrine therapy, without any signs of distant relapse or secondary malignancy AND\n* if primary diagnosis was 6 years or less before enrollment 8a. Intermediate to high clinical or genomic risk, defined as either one of the following criteria:\n* c or p or ypN 2-3 with/without (neo)adjuvant chemotherapy;\n* in patients with c/ypN0-1:\n* non-pCR in patients with G3 or c/ypN1\n* high biological risk defined as G3 with Ki-67 \u226540%\n* or high genomic risk (RS\\>25 (known or Oncotype Dx\u00ae in screening phase) or another test)\n* high CTS5 score or UICC stage IIb (clinical if neoadjuvant chemotherapy or pathological)\n\nOR, if patients do not fulfill above criteria:\n\n* patients \u226450 years old or pre-/perimenopausal and c or (y)pN1 disease (in particular if ET-non-response or no chemotherapy)\n* patients \\>50 years old and postmenopausal and c or (y)pN1 with intermediate genomic risk (RS\u226518) or non-low risk by another test\n\nET non-response definition:\n\nKi-67 post-treatment \\> 10% (central or local pathology value) OR 8b. Patients after isolated locoregional relapse with high-risk patterns (e.g., rpT2-3 or rpN1-3 or G3 or Ki-67 pre-treatment \u226520%), once surgery with free margins was completed Note: Inclusion is only possible for the first locoregional relapse removed by surgery (free margins) OR 8c. Patients with any high clinical risk at Investigator\u00b4s assessment but not fulfilling above criteria: consultation with sponsor required\n\nB. Prior to RANDOMIZATION in the study 9. Completed primary therapy of breast cancer according to current guidelines, i.e., after (neo)adjuvant treatment, definite surgery and radiotherapy, if applicable.\n\n10. No clinical evidence of distant metastasis (confirmation recommended prior to randomization by either combination of or either one of the following examinations: CT thorax / abdomen, chest X-ray, liver ultrasound, bone scan, PET-CT). 11. Patient has available tumor tissue from primary diagnostic biopsy. 12. No contraindication for adjuvant ET. 13. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 0-1. 14. Patient has adequate bone marrow and organ function as defined by the following laboratory values:\n\n* absolute neutrophil count \u2265 1.5 \u00d7 109/L,\n* platelets \u2265 100 \u00d7 109/L,\n* hemoglobin \u2265 8.0 g/dL,\n* total bilirubin \u2264 1.5 ULN, except for patients with Gilbert's Syndrome who may only be included if the total bilirubin is \u2264 2.0 \u00d7 ULN or direct bilirubin within normal ranges,\n* aspartate transaminase (AST) \u2264 3 \u00d7 ULN,\n* alanine transaminase (ALT) \u2264 3 \u00d7 ULN,\n* serum creatinine \u2264 1.5 x ULN. 15. Ability to swallow abemaciclib tablets or to administer other study medication, respectively.\n\n  16. Ability to communicate with the investigator and comply with study procedures.\n\n  17. Willing to receive therapy by clinical site, as required by the protocol.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\nPatients eligible for inclusion in this study must not meet any of the following criteria:\n\n1. Patient with distant metastases of breast cancer beyond regional lymph nodes.\n2. Previously received CDK 4/6 inhibitor.\n3. Patient with a known hypersensitivity to any of the excipients of abemaciclib or standard-of-care endocrine therapy.\n4. Patient has had major surgery within 14 days prior to starting study drug or has not recovered from major side effects.\n5. Patient has not recovered from clinical and laboratory acute toxicities related to prior anticancer therapies to NCI CTCAE version 5.0 Grade \u2264 1 (polyneuropathy \u2264 2 is allowed).\n6. Patient has a concurrent malignancy or non-breast malignancy within 5 years prior to randomization.\n7.

Patient has any active systemic bacterial infection (requiring intravenous antibiotics at time of initiating study treatment), fungal infection, or detectable viral infection (such as known human immunodeficiency virus positivity or with known active hepatitis B or C \\[for example, hepatitis B surface antigen positive\\]. Screening is not required for enrollment.\n9. Patient has any other concurrent severe and/or uncontrolled medical condition that would, in the investigator\u00b4s judgment, cause unacceptable safety risks, contraindicate patient participation in the clinical study, or compromise compliance with the protocol (e.g., interstitial lung disease, severe dyspnea at rest or requiring oxygen therapy, severe renal impairment \\[e.g. estimated creatinine clearance \\<30ml/min\\], history of major surgical resection involving the stomach or small bowel, or preexisting Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis or a preexisting chronic condition resulting in baseline Grade 2 or higher diarrhea, etc.).\n10. Patient has a personal history of any of the following conditions: syncope of cardiovascular etiology, ventricular arrhythmia of pathological origin (including, but not limited to, ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation), or sudden cardiac arrest.\n11. Patient is currently receiving any of the following substances, which cannot be discontinued 7 days prior to day 1 of study treatment:\n\n    o concomitant medications and herbal supplements, that are strong inducers or inhibitors of CYP3A4.\n12.
