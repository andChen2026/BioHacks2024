The tumor should be staged clinically as T2-T4 (minimum size \\>2.0 cm).\n* Patients must have a breast tumor that is resectable or potentially resectable following neoadjuvant chemotherapy and be willing to undergo resection, if indicated, after chemotherapy.\n* Patients may not have received prior chemotherapy or radiation therapy for their current breast cancer.\n* Patients may not have had a clip placed into the tumor that is not compatible with MRI.\n* Patients must be deemed eligible for neoadjuvant chemotherapy, as assessed by the clinical investigator.\n* Age \\> 18 years.\n* Patients must have an ECOG performance status (Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status: an attempt to quantify cancer patients' general well-being and activities of daily life. The score ranges from 0 to 5 where 0 is asymptomatic and 5 is death.) of 0 - 1.\n* Patients must not be pregnant or breast-feeding. Patients with reproductive potential must consent to the use of effective contraception while on the study.\n* Patients must have no contraindications to MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging) exams.
