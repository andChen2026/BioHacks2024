Routine blood test:\n\n       * Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) \u22651.5\u00d710\\^9/L\n       * Lymphocyte count (LC) \\>0.5\u00d710\\^9/L\n       * Platelets (PLT) \u2265100\u00d710\\^9/L\n       * Hemoglobin (Hb) \u226590 g/L\n    2. Liver function test:\n\n       * AST and ALT \u22642.5\u00d7ULN (\u22645\u00d7ULN for participants with liver metastases)\n       * ALP \u22642.5\u00d7ULN (\u22645\u00d7ULN for participants with liver or bone metastases)\n       * Total bilirubin \u22641.5\u00d7ULN (\u22643.0 mg/dL for participants with Gilbert's syndrome)\n    3. Renal function test:\n\n       \u2022 Calculated creatinine clearance (CrCL) \u226545 mL/min OR creatinine \u22641.5\u00d7ULN\n    4. Coagulation function test:\n\n       * APTT \u22641.5\u00d7ULN\n       * INR or PT \u22641.5\u00d7ULN\n    5. Doppler echocardiography:\n\n       \u2022 Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) \u226550%\n    6. Pulmonary function test:\n\n       * FEV1 \u226560%\n12. Female participants of childbearing potential must be willing to use an adequate method of contraception for the course of the study through one year (or longer as specified by local institutional guidelines) after the last dose of study treatment. Female subjects of childbearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test within 7 days prior to LNL infusion.\n13. Have recovered from prior therapy-related adverse events to Grade\u22641 per CTCAE version 5.0 criteria or met the criteria of normal organ function specified above prior to the surgery for obtaining the lymph nodes, except for second-degree peripheral nerve injury, alopecia, leukoderma, hypothyroidism controlled by thyroid hormone replacement therapy, type 1 diabetes controlled by insulin therapy, and other irreversible toxic events that would not be exacerbated by LNL infusion as judged by the investigator (e.g., hearing loss).\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\nThe participant must be excluded from participating in this trial if the participant:\n\n1. Has metastatic breast cancer.\n2. Has a known additional malignancy that is progressing or requires active treatment within the last 5 years. Exceptions include basal or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin, and thyroid cancer that has undergone potentially curative therapy or in situ cervical cancer.\n3.

Has interstitial pneumonia or active pneumonia that has clinical implications, or other respiratory diseases that seriously affect pulmonary function.\n5. Has an active infection requiring systemic therapy or has an unexplained fever of \\>38.5\u2103 except fevers caused by cancer.\n6. Has arterial and/or venous thrombotic events in the past 5 months, e.g., cerebrovascular accident, deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism.\n7. Has a known psychiatric, alcohol abuse or substance abuse disorders.\n8. Is pregnant or breastfeeding.\n9. Has an active autoimmune disease, a history of autoimmune disease, or autoimmune disease that has required systemic treatment (e.g., with use of prednisone at a dose of \\>10 mg per day or other corticosteroids at an equivalent dose). Replacement therapy (e.g., thyroxine, insulin, or physiologic corticosteroid replacement therapy for adrenal or pituitary insufficiency) is allowed.\n10. Has a history of congenital immunodeficiency or acquired immunodeficiency (e.g., positive serology test for HIV).\n11. Has tuberculosis in the past one year, or has a history of active tuberculosis more than one year but did not receive regular treatments.\n12. Has known active hepatitis B or hepatitis C. Participants that are hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) or hepatitis B core antigen (HBcAg) positive may participate provided that the HBV DNA level is normal. Participants that are hepatitis C antibody positive may participate provided that the HCV DNA level is normal. Carriers of HBV or HCV must receive anti-virus therapy, and take regular DNA copy number tests during this trial.\n13.
