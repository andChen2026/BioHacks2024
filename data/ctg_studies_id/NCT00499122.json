    "eligibilityCriteria": "Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Females age 18 years or older.\n* The ability to provide written informed consent prior to study specific screening procedures, with the understanding that the patient has the right to withdraw from the study at any time.\n* Histologically confirmed infiltrating (invasive) breast cancer by core needle biopsy, with no evidence of metastatic disease except to the ipsilateral axillary lymph nodes.\n* Clinical stage IIB - IIIC (T2-4, N0 or N1, M0 or - any T, N1-3, M0) breast cancer. The primary tumor must be greater than or equal to 2 cm (T2-4) or with pathologically proven axillary nodal involvement (N1-3).\n* Patients with inflammatory breast cancer (T4) are permitted into the study.\n* Clinically palpable tumor that meets the criteria of RECIST for palpable measurable disease. The primary tumor must be greater than or equal to 2 cm (T2-4) or with pathologically proven axillary nodal involvement (N1-3). Bilateral synchronic breast cancers are allowed but one of the primary tumors should be selected as the target tumor.\n* Primary tumor may be estrogen or progesterone receptor negative or positive, and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER-2/neu) negative as determined by either Fluorescent In Situ Hybridization (FISH) or 0-2+ staining by immunohistochemistry (IHC) (Hercept\u2122).\n* Normal cardiac ejection fraction (EF \u2265 50%) as determined by screening multigated acquisition scan (MUGA) or echocardiogram.\n* No prior history of myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure, symptomatic coronary artery disease, or cardiac arrhythmias.\n* Patients must be ambulatory with Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status of 0-1.\n* The patient or her caregiver must be able to self administer daily subcutaneous injections.\n* Life expectancy greater than 6 months.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Prior therapy of any modality for the treatment of breast cancer\n* Any prior therapy with an anthracycline or a taxane for any other indication\n* HER-2 positive breast cancer defined as either gene amplification by Fluorescent In Situ Hybridization (FISH) or 3+ staining by IHC (Hercept\u2122).\n* Women who have a positive pregnancy test, no pregnancy test available, who are pregnant or who are lactating.\n* Women of childbearing potential must agree to use a reliable and appropriate contraceptive method, which could include a double barrier method (condom plus diaphragm), an intrauterine device or oral contraceptives. Women with ER or PR positive breast cancer, should not, however, use oral contraceptives as a method of contraception. Postmenopausal women must have been amenorrheic for at least 12 months to be considered of non-childbearing potential.\n* Women with breast cancer that do not have palpable breast tumors at screening.\n* History of another malignancy within the last 5 years except curatively treated basal cell carcinoma of the skin or cervical intraepithelial neoplasia.\n* Clinically significant (i.e. active) cardiac disease (NYHA Grade II or greater congestive heart failure, symptomatic coronary artery disease, unstable angina, and cardiac arrhythmia not well-controlled with medication), myocardial infarction within the last 6 months prior to study start, or screening ejection fraction of \\< 50%.\n* Any of the following abnormal laboratory values:\n\n  * Absolute neutrophil count \\< 1.5 x 109/L\n  * Platelet count \\< 100 x 109/L\n  * Serum bilirubin \\> 1.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN)\n  * Serum alanine transaminase (ALT), aspartate transaminase (AST) \\> 2.5 x ULN\n  * Serum creatinine \\> 2.0 mg/dL or 177mmol/L or calculated creatinine clearance by the method of Cockcroft and Gault \\< 50mL/min).\n* Any severe or poorly controlled systemic disease (e.g., hypertension; clinically significant cardiovascular, pulmonary, or metabolic disease, disorders of wound-healing, ulcer or bone fracture).\n* Patients who have received any investigational treatment within 4 weeks of study start.\n* Known infection with HIV, Hepatitis B virus (HBV), or Hepatitis C virus (HCV).\n* Known hypersensitivity to any of the components of NOV-002 or to any of the study drugs.\n* Patients assessed by the investigator to be unable or unwilling to comply with the requirements of the protocol.",
