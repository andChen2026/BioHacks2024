    "eligibilityCriteria": "General inclusion criteria (cohort A and cohort B)\n\nPRE-SCREENING PHASE\n\nThe following criteria must be met to be eligible to entry into the pre-screening:\n\n1. Patient must be able to sign written pre-screening form prior to any molecular determination during the pre-screening phase.\n2. Being male or female aged \u2265 18 years.\n3. Histological confirmed MpBC as per local assessment.\n4. Known HR status according to the updated American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO)/College of American Pathologists (CAP) 2020 guidelines and HER2-negative breast cancer (BC) as per ASCO/CAP 2018 criteria based on local testing on the most recently analyzed biopsy.\n5. Prior treatment with at least one, but no more than four, prior lines of systemic therapy for advanced disease. Earlier adjuvant or neoadjuvant therapy for more limited disease will be considered as one of the required prior regimens if the development of unresectable locally advanced metastatic disease occurred within a 6-month period after completion of chemotherapy.\n6. No prior treatment with a PI3K/AKT/mTOR inhibitor (cohorts A and B), nor with eribulin (only for patients in cohort A).\n7. Patient must consent to give a tumor sample or/and a blood sample for testing of the prior mentioned alterations (or if needed and deemed safe by the investigator, able to provide a fresh tumor sample).\n8. Unknown PIK3CA mutational and PTEN loss status.\n\n   SCREENING PHASE\n\n   Patients must meet inclusion criteria 2 to 7 of the pre-screening phase and the following inclusion criteria of the screening phase to be eligible for enrollment into the Study:\n9. Patient must be able to sign written main informed consent form (ICF) prior to participation in any Study-related activities.\n10. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status must be 0 or 1 which the Investigator believes is stable at the time of screening.\n11. Life expectancy greater or equal to 12 weeks.\n12. Unresectable locally advanced/metastatic MpBC documented by computed tomography (CT) scan or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), that is not amenable to resection with curative intent.\n13. Patient has a PIK3CA mutation confirmed by MEDSIR's designated central lab, determined in the pre-screening phase or patient has a pathology report confirming PIK3CA mutant status by a certified laboratory (using validated PIK3CA mutation assay) either from tissue or blood\n\n    And/or\n\n    Patient has evidence of PTEN loss by immunohistochemistry (IHC) confirmed by MEDSIR's designated central lab in the pre-screening phase or patient has a pathology report confirming PTEN loss by a certified laboratory, preferably on the most recent available tumor sample.\n\n    Note:. PI3KCA mutations should have been evaluated at least at hot spots, E542, E545 and H1047. PTEN staining should have been evaluated by assessing both intensity of staining and percentage of positive cells. Both nuclear and cytoplasmic staining should be evaluated. Staining of normal cells such as benign breast epithelium, stromal cells and/or endothelial cells should have been evaluated as an internal control. Any tumor nuclear or cytoplasmic staining showing similar intensity with internal control cells should have been considered positive staining (no PTEN loss). Complete lack of staining or faint staining (cytoplasmic or nuclear) in up to 50% of tumor cells should have been considered as PTEN loss. If there was no staining in internal control cells, the staining should have been considered inconclusive.\n14. Patients with clinically stable metastatic CNS tumors who are not receiving steroid therapy or anticonvulsant at baseline are eligible if:\n\n    1. Stereotactic radiotherapy \u00b3 7 days prior to initiation of study treatment.\n    2. Whole-brain radiotherapy \u00b3 7 days prior to initiation of study treatment.\n    3. Neurosurgical resection \u00b3 28 days prior to initiation of study treatment.\n15. Resolution of all acute toxic effects of prior anti-cancer therapy to grade \u2264 1 as determined by the US National Cancer Institute-Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI-CTCAE) version 5.0 (v.5.0).\n\n    Note: Except for alopecia or other toxicities not considered a safety risk for the patient at investigator's discretion.\n16. Available archival tumor sample (FFPE tissue) of the most recent biopsy/surgery since last progression.\n\n    Note: Subjects for whom the most recent tumor biopsy since last progression could not be obtained (e.g., inaccessible tumor or subject safety concern) may submit archival pathological material from either metastatic or primary sites.\n17.
