Johnson General Hospital in the Harris Health System.\n2. Patients = or \\> 18 years old and \\< 75 years old.\n3. Patients scheduled to undergo paclitaxel chemotherapy for breast cancer.\n4. Patients with adequate renal function, as evidenced in laboratory values = or \\< 3 months old: epidermal growth factor receptor (eGFR) = or \\> 60 mL/min/1.73m2.\n5. Patients with adequate hepatic function per institutional testing standards, as evidenced in laboratory values = or \\< 3 months old: (1) The screening results for total bilirubin must be \\< 1.5 times the upper limit of normal. (2) The screening results for aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) must be \\< 2 times the upper limit of normal.\n6. Patients who speak English and/or Spanish.\n7. Patients who are willing and able to review, understand, and provide written consent.\n8. Patients with an Eastern Cooperative Oncology performance status of 0 or 1.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n1.

Patients using carbonic anhydrase inhibitors (acetazolamide \\[Diamox\u00ae\\], brinzolamide \\[Azopt\u00ae\\], methazolamide \\[Neptazane\u00ae\\], dorzolamide \\[Trusopt\u00ae\\], pomegranate ellagitannins), cimetidine, or topiramate.\n3. Patients who are enrolled in another symptom management trial.\n4. Patients with nerve pathology or clinically identified neuropathy.\n5. Patients with a history of clinically significant cutaneous drug reaction, hypersensitivity reaction, anaphylaxis, or any other serious adverse reaction to the medication used in the study.\n6. Patients with any condition associated with increased risk of metformin-associated lactic acidosis (e.g., congestive heart failure defined as New York Heart Association Class III or IV functional status, history of acidosis of any type).\n7.
