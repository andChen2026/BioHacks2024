(Prior adjuvant trastuzumab is allowed but not required). A 2 week period is required between the last dose of trastuzumab treatment and first dose of the test article.\n* Prior treatment with a taxane in the neoadjuvant, adjuvant, locally advanced, and/or metastatic disease treatment setting.\n\nPARTS 1 and 2:\n\n* At least 1 measurable lesion as defined by RECIST criteria.\n* LVEF within institutional range of normal as measured by multi-gated acquisition (MUGA) or echocardiogram (ECHO).\n\nEXCLUSION CRITERIA\n\nPART 2:\n\n* prior treatment with capecitabine, lapatinib (20 subjects with prior lapatinib exposure will be enrolled) or any erbB-2 targeted agents except trastuzumab. Treatment with erbB-2 targeted therapy must exceed 2 weeks (14 days) in order to be exclusionary.\n* prior treatment with anthracyclines with a cumulative dose of doxorubicin of greater than 400 mg/m\u00b2, epirubicin dose of greater than 800 mg/m\u00b2, or the equivalent dose for other anthracyclines.\n\nPARTS 1 and 2:\n\n* Subjects with bone as the only site of disease.\n* Active uncontrolled or symptomatic central nervous system (CNS) metastases, as indicated by clinical symptoms, cerebral edema, and/or progressive growth. Subjects with a history of CNS metastases or cord compression are allowable if they have been considered definitively treated and are off anticonvulsants and steroids for at least 4 weeks before the first dose of test article.\n* Any other cancer within 5 years prior to screening with the exception of adequately treated cervical carcinoma in situ, or adequately treated basal or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin.",
