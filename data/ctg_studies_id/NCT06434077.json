Informed Consent:\n  * Ability to understand and willingness to sign a written informed consent document.\n\n    9. Compliance:\n  * Willingness and ability to comply with the study protocol, including scheduled visits, treatment plans, laboratory tests, and other study procedures. 10. Nagalase Levels: \u2022 Elevated serum nagalase levels above the normal range, indicating active tumor burden.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Concurrent Malignancies:\n\n  * Presence of other active malignancies (excluding adequately treated basal cell or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin or carcinoma in situ of the cervix). 2. Severe Comorbid Conditions:\n  * Severe uncontrolled concurrent illness, such as significant cardiovascular disease (e.g., uncontrolled hypertension, recent myocardial infarction), severe pulmonary conditions (e.g., uncontrolled asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease), or active infections requiring systemic therapy. 3. Pregnancy and Lactation:\n  * Pregnant or breastfeeding women. 4. Previous GcMAF Treatment:\n  * Previous treatment with GcMAF. 5. Allergies and Sensitivities:\n  * Known hypersensitivity to any component of the study drug or its formulation.",
