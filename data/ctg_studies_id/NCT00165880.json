Patients must not have clinical symptoms from brain metastases and must not be taking corticosteroids for the treatment of brain metastases. Patients must not have leptomeningeal metastases.\n* Concurrent or previous malignancy of a different tumor type within five years of starting the study except for adequately treated non-melanoma skin cancer or cervical intraepithelial neoplasia.\n* Any of the following laboratory parameters:\n\n  1. hemoglobin \\<10 g/dl;\n  2. neutrophils \\<1.5 x 109/L;\n  3. platelets \\<100 x 109/L;\n  4. serum bilirubin \\>25 \u00b5mol/l (1.5 mg/dl);\n  5. other liver parameters \\>2.5 x upper normal limit (ULN) (\\> 5 x upper normal limit in the presence of hepatic metastases);\n  6. serum creatinine \\>1.5 x ULN;\n  7. serum calcium (corrected for albumin) \\>=11.5 mg/dl.\n* Uncontrolled infections.\n* Clinically significant cardiac impairment or unstable ischemic heart disease including a myocardial infarction within six months of study start.\n* Malabsorption syndrome or other condition which may affect drug absorption.\n* History of hypersensitivity to sulfonamides.\n* Prior severe or unexpected reaction to fluoropyrimidine therapy (which may be explained by dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase deficiency or hypersensitivity to 5-fluorouracil).\n* Any treatment with investigational drugs within 30 days before the start of the study.\n* Pregnancy or lactation (all women of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test before inclusion in the study; post-menopausal women must be amenorrheic for at least 12 months).
