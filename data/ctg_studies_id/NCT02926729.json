(Pregnant women will be excluded from this study because radiation therapy is contraindicated during pregnancy.)\n* Current invasive cancer or DCIS at the site of a previous surgery.\n* Any systemic neoadjuvant (or preoperative) therapy between the core biopsy and lumpectomy.\n* Involvement in another therapeutic trial for breast cancer at Dana Farber or elsewhere.\n* Risk of poor cosmetic outcome after initial lumpectomy and possible additional excision, as assessed by a study surgeon.\n* Recommendation for mastectomy based on radiology.\n* Patients that have complex DCIS as indicated on radiology, which would require excising a large tissue volume.\n* No or equivocal ER, PR or HER2 testing performed prior to surgery if biopsy indicates invasive cancer.\n* No or equivocal ER testing performed prior to surgery if biopsy indicates ductal carcinoma in situ.",
