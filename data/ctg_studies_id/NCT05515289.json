    "eligibilityCriteria": "Inclusion Criteria:\n\n- Subjects with renal insufficiency\n\n1. Sign an informed consent form before the test, and fully understand the content, process and possible adverse reactions of the test;\n2. Age 18 to 70 years old, gender is not limited;\n3. Body mass index (BMI) in the range of 19 kg/m2 to 28 kg/m2 (including both ends);\n4. Renal function index (expressed in GFR, by the MDRD formula (refer to Appendix I) meets the following criteria: Subjects with mild renal insufficiency (stage CKD2): 60-89 mL/min (both ends included)\uff1bSubjects with moderate renal insufficiency (stage CKD3): 30-59 mL/min (both ends included)\uff1b\n5. The renal function state is stable, and the GFR results of the two tests before administration (the interval between the two tests should be at least 3 days) should be within the same CKD segmentation period;\n6. Fertile female subjects must undergo a pregnancy test before administration and the result is negative; must be non-lactating; Female subjects with fertility who used medically approved, highly effective contraception for 7 months from the signing of informed consent to the last dose; Male subjects whose partners are fertile women, who use medically approved, highly effective contraception for 4 months after the last dose; There are no sperm donations, egg donations and fertility plans.\n\nHealthy subjects\n\n1. Sign an informed consent form before the test, and fully understand the content, process and possible adverse reactions of the test;\n2. Age 18 to 70 years old, gender is not limited;\n3. Body mass index (BMI) in the range of 19 kg/m2 to 28 kg/m2 (including both ends);\n4. Renal function index (expressed in GFR, calculated as above) \u2265 90 mL/min and \\< 130 mL/min;\n5. Comprehensive vital signs examination, physical examination, routine laboratory examination (blood routine, blood biochemistry, urine routine, coagulation function, etc.), 12-lead ELECTROCardiogram, X-chest x-ray or chest CT, abdominal ultrasound and other examinations have been judged by the researchers to be normal or abnormal and have no clinical significance;\n6.
