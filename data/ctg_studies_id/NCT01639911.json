Female patient is either post-menopausal or surgically sterilized or willing to use an acceptable method of birth control (ie, a hormonal contraceptive, intra-uterine device, diaphragm with spermicide, condom with spermicide, or abstinence) for the duration of the study and for 4 months after the last dose of alisertib.\n10. Male patient agrees to use an acceptable method for contraception during the entire study treatment period through 4 months after the last dose of alisertib.\n11. Voluntary written consent before performance of any study-related procedure not part of normal medical care, with the understanding that consent may be withdrawn by the patient at any time without prejudice to future medical care.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n1. Untreated or symptomatic CNS metastases\n2. Radiation therapy to more than 25% of the bone marrow. Whole pelvic radiation is is considered to be over 25%.\n3. Prior allogeneic bone marrow transplantation\n4. \u2265 Grade 2 peripheral neuropathy within 14 days before enrollment\n5. Known history of uncontrolled sleep apnea and other conditions that could result in excessive daytime sleepiness, such as severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; requirement for supplemental oxygen.\n6. Requirement for constant admin. of proton pump inhibitor, H2 antagonist, or pancreatic enzymes. Intermittent uses of antacids or H2 antagonists are allowed as described in the protocol.\n7.

Myocardial infarction within 6 months prior to enrollment or has New York Heart Association (NYHA) Class II, III or IV heart failure, uncontrolled angina, severe uncontrolled ventricular arrhythmias, or electrocardiographic evidence of acute ischemia or active conduction system abnormalities requiring therapy. Prior to study entry, any ECG abnormality at Screening has to be documented by the investigator as not medically relevant.\n9. Pregnant or breast-feeding. Pazopanib is Pregnancy Category D - known teratogenic potential. Confirmation that the subject is not pregnant must be established by a negative serum beta-human chorionic gonadotropin (beta-hCG) pregnancy test result obtained during screening. Pregnancy testing is not required for post-menopausal or surgically sterilized women.\n10. Patient has received other investigational drugs with 14 days before enrollment\n11. Serious medical or psychiatric illness in the opinion of the researcher that would likely interfere with participation in this clinical study.\n12. Other severe acute or chronic medical or psychiatric condition, including uncontrolled diabetes, malabsorption, resection of the pancreas or upper small bowel, requirement for pancreatic enzymes, any condition that would modify small bowel absorption of oral medications, or laboratory abnormality that may increase the risk associated with study participation or investigational product administration or may interfere with the interpretation of study results and, in the judgment of the investigator, would make the patient inappropriate for enrollment in this study.\n13. Treatment with clinically significant enzyme inducers, such as the enzyme-inducing antiepileptic drugs phenytoin, carbamazepine or phenobarbital, or rifampin, rifabutin, rifapentine or St. John's wort within 14 days prior to the first dose of alisertib and during the study.\n14. Treatment should be avoided (however not prohibited) with strong UGT inhibitors such as atazanavir, gemfibrozil, indinavir, ketoconazole, Silybum marianum (milk thistle), Valeriana officinalis (garden valerian) or inducers such as carbamazepine, nicotine, Orthosiphon stamineus within 14 days prior to the first dose of alisertib and during the study.\n15. Known history of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, hepatitis B, or hepatitis C. Testing is not required in the absence of clinical findings or suspicion.\n16. Recent (within 6 months) arterial thromboembolic events, including transient ischemic attack (TIA), cerebrovascular accident (CVA), unstable angina, or myocardial infarction (MI).

History of thrombotic or hemorrhagic disorders, not receiving chronic daily treatment with aspirin (\\>325 mg/day) or non-steriodal anti-inflammatory agents know to inhibit platelet function. Treatment with dipyridamole (persantine), ticlopidine (Ticlid), clopidogrel (Plavix) and/or cilostazol (Pletal).\n18. Use of simvastatin is not recommended but not prohibited. The concomitant use of pazopanib and simvastatin increases the risk of ALT elevations. Discontinue simvastatin if possible to decrease risk of transaminases elevation from pazopanib. There are insufficient data available to assess the risk of alternative statins. If it must be continued, monitor liver function closely and follow dosing guidelines.\n19. History of abdominal fistula, gastrointestinal perforation, or intra abdominal abscess within 28 days prior to beginning study treatment\n20.

Poorly controlled hypertension \\[defined as systolic blood pressure (SBP) of \u2265140 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure (DBP) of \u2265 90mmHg\\]. Note: Initiation or adjustment of antihypertensive medication(s) is permitted prior to study entry. The mean SBP / DBP values from each blood pressure assessment must be \\< 140/90mmHg in order for a subject to be eligible for the study.\n24. History of cerebrovascular accident, pulmonary embolism or untreated deep venous thrombosis (DVT) within the past 6 months. Note: Subjects with recent DVT who have been treated with therapeutic anti-coagulating agents for at least 6 weeks are eligible.
