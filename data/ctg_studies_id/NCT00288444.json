This range is defined as \u2264 2 x ULN.\n\nIn determining eligibility, the more abnormal of the two (AST or ALT) should be used.\n\n3.1.8 Patient must have received no more than three previous chemotherapy regimens (prior chemotherapy may or may not have contained a taxane).\n\n3.1.9 Patient must meet the specified informed consent requirement.\n\n3.1.10 Patient must be of age \u2265 18 years.\n\n3.1.11 Women of childbearing age must have a negative pregnancy test.\n\n3.1.12 Men and women of childbearing potential must be willing to consent to using effective contraception while on treatment and for at least 3 months thereafter.\n\n3.1.13 Patient must have \u2264 Grade 1 neurotoxicity from previous anticancer treatment or from any cause.\n\n3.1.14 Patient must have adequate coagulation function: INR and PTT \u2264 1.5 x ULN.\n\n3.1.15 Patient must have discontinued all prior chemotherapy and radiotherapy at least 4 weeks prior to registration.\n\n3.1.16 Patient must have discontinued use of the following drugs which are an inducers or inhibitors of CYP3A4 at least 2 days prior to registration: ethinylestradiol, gestodene, itraconazole, ketoconazole, cimetidine, erythromycin, carbamazepine, high dose chronic steroids, phenobarbital, phenytoin, rifampin (rifampcin), and sulfinpyrazone.\n\nPatient must have a pathologically-confirmed\n\n-\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n3.2.1 Patient has received more than three previous chemotherapy regimens.\n\n3.2.2 Patient is pregnant or breast feeding.\n\n3.2.3 Patient has signs of symptoms of acute infection requiring systemic therapy.\n\n3.2.4 Patient exhibits confusion, disorientation, or has a history of major psychiatric illness which may impair the patient's understanding of the informed consent.\n\n3.2.5 Patient's life expectancy is less than 12 weeks.\n\n3.2.6 Patient has \\> Grade 1 neurotoxicity from previous anticancer treatment or significant neuropathy from any cause.\n\n3.2.7 Patient requires total parenteral nutrition with lipids.\n\n3.2.8 Inability to swallow the lonafarnib BID.\n\n3.2.9 Patient has a history of uncontrolled heart disease (including clinically significant coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure and symptomatic or uncontrolled arrythmias).\n\n3.2.10 Patient has a history of severe hypersensitivity reaction to docetaxel or other drugs formulated with polysorbate 80. Symptoms include: any reaction such as bronchospasm, generalized urticaria, systolic BP \u2264 80mm Hg, and angioedema.\n\n3.2.11 Use of chronic steroids or anticonvulsants.\n\n-",
