    "eligibilityCriteria": "Inclusion Criteria:\n\n1. Signed informed consent form (ICF) prior to participation in any study-related activities.\n2. Male or female patients \u2265 18 years at the time of signing ICF.\n3. Ability to comply with the study protocol, in the investigator's judgment.\n4. Histologically confirmed TNBC -regardless of PD-L1 status- per American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO)/College of American Pathologists (CAP) criteria based on local testing on the most recent analyzed biopsy. Triple-negative is defined as \\<1% expression for estrogen receptor (ER) and progesterone receptor (PgR) as determined by immunohistochemistry (IHC), and negative for HER2 (0-1+ by immunohistochemistry \\[IHC\\] or 2+ and negative by in situ hybridization \\[ISH\\] test).\n5. Unresectable locally advanced or metastatic disease documented by computerized tomography (CT) scan or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) that is not amenable to resection with curative intent.\n6. No prior chemotherapy and/or targeted therapy and/or immunotherapy and/or antiangiogenic agent for triple negative MBC. Patients who have received (neo)adjuvant taxane-based chemotherapy and/or immunotherapy and/or an antiangiogenic agent are required to have a disease-free interval (DFI) of at least 12 months after completion of each of these treatments. For (neo)adjuvant non-taxane-based chemotherapy, a DFI of at least 6 months is required.\n7. Resolution of all acute toxic effects of prior anti-cancer therapy to grade \u2264 1 as determined by the NCI-CTCAE v.5.0 (except for alopecia, grade \u2264 2 peripheral neuropathy, or other toxicities not considered a safety risk for the patient at investigator's discretion).\n8. Evidence of measurable disease or non-measurable disease as per RECIST v.1.1. Patients with only bone lesions are also eligible.\n9. Willingness and ability to provide the most recent tumor biopsy since last progression from either metastatic or primary tissues at the time of the inclusion to perform exploratory studies. If not feasible, patient eligibility should be evaluated by a Sponsor's qualified designee. An additional tumor biopsy from either metastatic or primary (only if metastatic biopsies cannot be obtained for inaccessible lesion or subject safety concern) tissues will be collected as soon as possible at disease progression or study termination whenever it is feasible.\n\n   Note: Patients for whom tumor biopsies cannot be obtained (e.g., inaccessible tumor or safety concern) may submit archived pathological material from either metastatic or primary sites, but the most recent tumor biopsy from the patient should be obtained when available.\n\n   Note 2: Bone biopsies are only acceptable if performed on bone metastases with associated soft tissue mass, where the biopsy is performed on the soft tissue mass, and a decalcification process is not used. Cytology samples and decalcified bone specimens are unacceptable due to lack of validation studies.\n10. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status of 0 or 1.\n11.

The use of G-CSF within 14 days prior to C1D1 is also prohibited.\n\n    b. Hepatic: Total bilirubin \u2264 1.5 times the upper limit of normal (\u00d7 ULN) (\u2264 3 x ULN in the case of Gilbert's disease); aspartate transaminase (AST) and alanine transaminase (ALT) \u2264 2.5 \u00d7 ULN (in the case of liver metastases \u2264 5 \u00d7 ULN); alkaline phosphatase (ALP) \u2264 2.5 \u00d7 ULN (\u2264 5 \u00d7 ULN in the case of liver and/or bone metastases).\n\n    c. Serum albumin \u2265 2.5 g/dL\n\n    d. Renal: Serum creatinine \\< 1.5 \u00d7 ULN or creatinine clearance \u2265 50 mL/min based on Cockcroft-Gault glomerular filtration rate estimation.

Current treatment with anti-viral therapy for HBV is not allowed.\n\n    Note: HBV DNA test only to be performed for patients with a positive total HBcAb test.\n15. Negative hepatitis C virus (HCV) antibody test at screening, or positive HCV antibody test followed by a negative HCV RNA test at screening.\n\n    Note: HCV RNA test only to be performed for patients with a positive HCV antibody test.\n16.
