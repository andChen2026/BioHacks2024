Childbearing potential, has a negative serum pregnancy test at Screening and agrees to one of the following: double-barrier contraception (condom with spermicidal jelly, foam, suppository, or film; diaphragm with spermicide; or male condom and diaphragm); complete abstinence from sexual intercourse from two weeks prior to administration of the study drug, throughout the active study treatment period; vasectomized partner who is sterile prior to the female subject's entry and is the sole sexual partner for that female.\n* Is able to swallow and retain oral medication.\n* ECOG performance status 0 to 2.\n* Adequate bone marrow function.\n* Hemoglobin \u2265 9 gm/dL.\n* Absolute granulocyte count \u22651,500/mm3 (1.5 x 109/L).\n* Platelets \u2265 75,000/mm3 (75 x 109/L).\n* Calculated creatinine clearance (CrCl) \u2265 50 ml/min based on Cockcroft and Gault\n* Total bilirubin \u2264 1.5 X upper limit of normal of institutional values and INR \u2264 1.5.\n* Alanine transaminase (ALT) \u2264 three times the upper limit of the institutional values or \u2264 five times ULN with documented liver metastases.\n* Has a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) within the normal institutional range based on ECHO or MUGA.\n* Life expectancy of \u226512 weeks\n* Capable of giving written informed consent, which includes compliance with the requirements and restrictions listed in the consent form.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Is pregnant or lactating.\n* Has malabsorption syndrome, a disease affecting gastrointestinal function, or resection of the stomach or small bowel.\n* Has current active hepatic or biliary disease (with exception of patients with Gilbert's syndrome, asymptomatic gallstones, liver metastases or stable chronic liver disease per investigator assessment).\n* Has evidence of symptomatic or uncontrolled brain metastases or leptomeningeal disease.
