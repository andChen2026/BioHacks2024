Prior treatment with both an anthracycline (i.e., doxorubicin or epirubicin) and a taxane (i.e., paclitaxel or docetaxel) at least (acceptable for patients not previously treated with anthracyclines due to high risk factors for cardiotoxicity), and four prior chemotherapy regimens at most\uff1b\n7.

Good compliance and willingness to cooperate with follow-up visits.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n1. Patients who have severe allergic reactions to mitoxantrone hydrochloride or liposome preparation ingredients;\n2. History of other malignancy within 3 years, except for radical cure of carcinoma in situ of the cervix, basal cell carcinoma or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin;\n3. Brain metastases and meningeal metastasis;\n4. Patients with active hepatitis B (HBsAg positive with hepatitis B virus DNA \u2265 2000 IU/mL), active hepatitis C (hepatitis C virus antibody positive with hepatitis C virus RNA above the lower limit of detection of the study center), or human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) antibody positive;\n5. Life expectancy \\< 3 months;\n6. Previous treatment with the anthracyclines, with the total cumulative dose (doxorubicin equivalent) \\>350 mg/m2;\n7. Adverse events from the previous treatment have not resolved to \u2264 Grade 1 based on CTCAE (except for the toxicity without safety risk judged by the investigator, such as alopecia, hyperpigmentation);\n8. Impaired cardiac function or serious cardiac disease:\n\n   * Long corrected QT interval syndrome or corrected QT interval \\> 480 ms;\n   * Complete left bundle branch block, II-III degree atrioventricular block;\n   * Severe, uncontrolled arrhythmias requiring pharmacological treatment;\n   * History of chronic congestive heart failure, New York Heart Association \u2265 grade 3;\n   * Cardiac ejection fraction \\< 50% within 6 months prior to screening;\n   * Heart valve disease with CTCAE \u2265 grade 3;\n   * ECG evidence of myocardial infarction, unstable angina, severe ventricular arrhythmias, history of severe pericardial disease, and acute ischemic or active conduction system abnormalities within 6 months prior to screening;\n9.

Any anticancer treatment (including chemotherapy, radiotherapy, molecular targeted therapy, immunotherapy, endocrine therapy) within 4 weeks prior to the first dose, immunomodulators as adjuvant therapy for malignancy within 2 weeks prior to the first dose, any anti-tumor proprietary Chinese medicine (except for those in the category of supporting and relieving symptoms) within 2 weeks prior to the first dose;\n12. Patients who enrolled in any other clinical trials within 4 weeks prior to the first dose;\n13. Patients who undergone major surgery within 12 weeks before the first dose, or have a surgical schedule during the study period;\n14. Patients with thrombosis or thromboembolism within 6 months prior to screening;\n15. Lactating female;\n16. Serious and/or uncontrolled medical condition that, in the judgment of the investigator, may affect the patient's participation in this study (including, but not limited to: diabetes not effectively controlled, kidney disease requiring dialysis, severe liver disease, life-threatening autoimmune and bleeding disorders, substance abuse, neurological disorders, etc.);\n17.
