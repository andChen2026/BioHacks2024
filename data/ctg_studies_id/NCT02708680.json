If participant has a history of treated asymptomatic CNS metastases they are eligible, provided they meet all of the following criteria: participant has measurable disease outside CNS; participant does not have metastases to midbrain, pons, medulla or spinal cord; participant is not on corticosteroids as therapy for CNS disease (anticonvulsants at a stable dose are allowed); participant has not had whole-brain radiation within 6 weeks prior to study enrollment; participant has stable CNS disease as demonstrated by at least 4 weeks of stability between the last intervention scan and the study screening scan.\n5. ECOG performance status of 0 or 1.\n6. Has acceptable, applicable laboratory parameters.\n7. Female participants must not be pregnant; willing to use 2 methods of birth control/abstinence if applicable through 120 days after the last dose of study drug.\n8.

Any contraindication to oral agents or significant nausea and vomiting, malabsorption, or significant small bowel resection that, in the opinion of the investigator, would preclude adequate absorption.\n6. Received a live vaccine within 30 days of the first dose of treatment.\n7. Prior anti-cancer monoclonal antibody (mAb) within 4 weeks prior to enrollment or who has not recovered from AEs due to mAb agents administered more than 4 weeks earlier.\n8. Prior chemotherapy within 3 weeks, targeted small molecule therapy or radiation therapy within 2 weeks prior to enrollment, or who has not recovered (i.e., \u2264Grade 1 at enrollment) from AEs due to a previously administered agent.\n9. Received transfusion of blood products or administration of colony stimulating factors within 4 weeks prior to the first dose of treatment.\n10.
