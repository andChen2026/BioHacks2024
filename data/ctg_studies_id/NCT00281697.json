    "eligibilityCriteria": "Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Signed informed consent form.\n* \u2265 18 years of age.\n* Histologically confirmed carcinoma of the breast with measurable or non-measurable metastatic disease that has progressed (patients with a history of brain metastasis are eligible for study participation \\[USA only\\], as long as their brain metastases have been treated and they have no evidence of progression or hemorrhage after treatment and no ongoing requirement for dexamethasone).\n* Progression of disease during or following administration of one (non-investigational) chemotherapy regimen administered in the first-line setting.\n* Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1.\n* For women of childbearing potential, use of an effective means of non-hormonal contraception.\n* Life expectancy \u2265 3 months.\n* Willingness and capacity to comply with study and follow-up procedures.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Prior hormonal therapy only as treatment for metastatic disease without chemotherapy. Patients must have received chemotherapy for their metastatic disease in the first-line setting. Hormone therapy alone is not allowed.\n* For subjects who have received prior anthracycline-based therapy, documentation of left ventricular ejection fraction \\< 50% by either multiple gated acquisition (MUGA) or echocardiogram (ECHO).\n* Treatment with more than one prior cytotoxic regimen for metastatic breast cancer (MBC).\n* HER2-positive status (patients who have unknown HER2 status, and for whom determination of HER2 status is not possible, are eligible for this study).\n* Unknown estrogen receptor (ER) and progesterone receptor (PR) status.\n* Radiation therapy other than for palliation or brain metastasis, biologic therapy, or chemotherapy for MBC within 21 days prior to Day 0 (Day 1 of Cycle 1 of treatment).\n* Prior therapy with bevacizumab or other vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) pathway-targeted therapy.\n* Untreated brain metastasis.\n* Inadequately controlled hypertension.\n* Unstable angina.\n* New York Heart Association Grade II or greater congestive heart failure (CHF).\n* History of myocardial infarction within 6 months prior to Day 0 (the day of the first bevacizumab/placebo infusion).\n* History of stroke or transient ischemic attack within 6 months prior to Day 0.\n* Clinically significant peripheral vascular disease.\n* Evidence of bleeding diathesis or coagulopathy.\n* Major surgical procedure, open biopsy, or significant traumatic injury within 28 days prior to Day 0; anticipation of need for major elective surgical procedure during the study.\n* Minor surgical procedures, fine-needle aspirations, or core biopsies within 7 days prior to Day 0.\n* History of abdominal fistula, gastrointestinal perforation, or intra-abdominal abscess within 6 months prior to Day 0.\n* Serious, non-healing wound, ulcer, or bone fracture.\n* History of anaphylactic reaction to monoclonal antibody therapy not controlled with treatment premedication.\n* History of other malignancies within 5 years of Day 0, except for tumors with a negligible risk for metastasis or death, such as adequately controlled basal cell carcinoma or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin or carcinoma in situ of the cervix.\n* inadequate organ function.\n* Pregnancy (positive serum pregnancy test) or lactation.\n* Any other diseases, metabolic dysfunction, physical examination finding, or clinical laboratory finding giving reasonable suspicion of a disease or condition that contraindicates the use of an investigational drug or that may affect the interpretation of the results or renders the subject at high risk from treatment complications.",
