    "eligibilityCriteria": "Inclusion criteria:\n\n1. histologically confirmed pancreatic cancer, virus-associated tumors \\[including papillomaviruses-related cancers (cervical, head and neck, and nasal), Epstein-Barr virus (nasopharyngeal carcinoma) and Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpes virus), non-small cell lung cancer, soft-tissue sarcomas, bladder cancer, triple negative breast cancer. For population 4, diagnosis must be confirmed by the RRePS Network as recommended by the French NCI. For population 2, papillomavirus-related cancers must be eligible whatever the genotype but in case of viral genotype is not available, IHC p16 positive must be provided, hepatocellular carcinoma must be confirmed by Hepatite B or C infection, HHV-8 and Epstein-Barr virus related cancers must be confirmed by molecular analysis,\n2. Metastatic disease,\n3. Age \u2265 18 years,\n4. ECOG \u2264 1,\n5. At least two lesions: one extra cerebral lesion that can be treated by radiotherapy and one site of disease that must be uni-dimensionally \u2265 10 mm considered as measurable according to RECIST v1.1. This lesion will not be treated by radiotherapy, however, note that lesion(s) that will be treated by radiotherapy will also be considered as measurable. Note that the largest size of the metastases to be irradiated will be 3cm and at that previous irradiation of these lesions is not allowed,\n6. Life expectancy \\> 6 months,\n7. At least one tumor site that can be biopsied for research purpose.

Availability of archived paraffin-embedded tumor tissue for research purpose,\n9. Participant must have advanced disease and must not be a candidate for other approved therapeutic regimen known to provide significant clinical benefit based on investigator judgement,\n10. Participants who received prior anti-PD-1/L1 therapy must fulfill the following requirements - population 3 and population 5 only\n\n    * Have achieved a complete response, partial response or stable disease and subsequently had disease progression while still on anti-PD-1/L1 therapy\n    * Have received at least two doses of an approved anti-PD-1/L1 therapy (by any regulatory authority)\n    * Have demonstrated disease progression as defined by RECIST v1.1 within 18 weeks from the last dose of the anti- PD-1/L1 therapy.\n11.

History of severe allergic anaphylactic reactions to chimeric, human or humanized antibodies, or fusion proteins,\n7. Treatment with systemic immunosuppressive medications including, but not limited to, cyclophosphamide, azathioprine, methotrexate, thalidomide, and anti-TNF agents within 2 weeks prior to inclusion.\n8. Major surgical procedure, open biopsy or significant traumatic injury within 28 days before inclusion,\n9. Any of the following cardiac criteria: congestive heart failure \u2265 New York Heart Association (NYHA) class 2, unstable angina, new-onset angina, myocardial infarction less than 6 months before inclusion, uncontrolled cardiac arrhythmias, known left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) \\<50%, previously experience of pericardial disorder\n10.
