ECOG performance status 0-2\n7. Negative urine pregnancy test (within 2 hours prior to injection of imaging agent) in women of child bearing age and willingness to use contraception (barrier, abstinence, non-hormonal) for 3 weeks after injection of \\[18F\\]GE-226\n8. Life expectancy \\> 3 months\n9. Adequate organ function as defined by\n\n   * Hb\u226510g/L\n   * WBC\u22653.0 x 109/L\n   * PLT\u226580 x 109/L\n   * Serum creatinine \u22641.4mg/dl\n   * SGOT and SGPT \u22642 x ULN\n   * Total bilirubin \u2264 2 x ULN or 3.0 mg/dl in patients with Gilbert's syndrome\n10.

Pregnant or lactating women.\n2. History of cardiac disease (myocardial infarction, arrhythmias requiring therapy, symptomatic valvular disease, cardiomyopathy, or pericarditis).\n3. Evidence of significant medical condition or laboratory finding which, in the opinion of the Investigator, makes it undesirable for the patient to participate in the trial.\n4.
