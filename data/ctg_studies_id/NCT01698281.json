Measurable disease by RECIST 1.1 criteria; at least one target lesion that has not been previously irradiated.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n1. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status \\> 2\n2. Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia or recent myocardial infarction (within 6 months of enrollment)\n3. Leptomeningeal disease or brain metastases requiring steroids or other therapeutic intervention\n4. Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) \\< 50 %, determined by echocardiogram or MUGA scan\n5. Compromised organ or marrow function as evidenced by any of the following:\n\n   * thrombocyte count: \\< 100x109/L\n   * absolute neutrophil count (ANC): \\< 1.5x109/L\n   * hemoglobin: \\< 6.0 mmol/L (\\< 9 g/100 mL)\n   * AS(A)T, AL(A)T: \\> 2.5 times upper limit of normal range (ULN) (\\> 5x ULN if clearly related to liver metastases)\n   * bilirubin: \\> 1.5 mg/dL\n   * creatinine: \\> 1.5 mg/dL or creatinine clearance \\< 40 mL/min.\n6. Systemic anticancer therapy or radiotherapy within 21 calendar days of the first dose of study drug\\*)\n\n   \\* also excluded are patients with anticipated ongoing concomitant anticancer therapy during the study\n7. Prior exposure to anthracyclines or anthracenediones for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer including liposomal doxorubicin (Doxil), doxorubicin, daunorubicin, or mitoxantrone\n8. Prior adjuvant anthracyclines with a cumulative anthracycline dose \u2265 300 mg/m2\n9. Ongoing therapeutic anticoagulation\n10. Patients who are not surgically sterile or post-menopausal must agree to use for the duration of the study reliable methods of birth control defined as:\n\n    * complete abstinence\n    * any intrauterine device (IUD) with published data showing that the lowest expected failure rate is \\< 1 % per year, or\n    * any other methods with published data showing that the lowest expected failure rate is less than 1 % per year\n11. Investigational therapy within 30 calendar days of the first scheduled day of protocol treatment (investigational therapy is defined as treatment for which there is currently no regulatory authority approved indication).",
