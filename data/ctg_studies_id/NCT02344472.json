which cannot be treated by surgery or radiotherapy only\n* Pre- and postmenopausal women are allowed\n* No more than two prior chemotherapies for metastatic disease\n* No more than two prior anti-HER2 therapies for metastatic disease\n* Pertuzumab retreatment is allowed if prior pertuzumab treatment was finished 12 months before\n* At least one measurable lesion assessable using standard techniques by Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Version 1.1 (RECIST v1.1)\n* Tumor evaluation according to RECIST version 1.1 has been performed within 4 weeks before randomization based on local assessment\n* Age \u2265 18 years\n* Standard 12-lead ECG values assessed by the local laboratory:\n\n  * QTcF interval at screening \\< 450 msec (using Fridericia's correction)\n  * Resting heart rate 50-90 bpm\n* Left ventricular cardiac ejection fraction (LVEF) \u2265 50% at baseline (as measured by echocardiogram)\n* ECOG Score \u2264 2\n* Adequate organ function within 14 days before randomization, evidenced by the following laboratory results below:\n\n  * absolute neutrophil count \u2265 1500 cells/\u00b5L,\n  * platelet count \u2265 100000 cells/\u00b5L,\n  * hemoglobin \u2265

bilirubin \u2264 1.5 \u00d7 ULN (with the exception of Gilbert's syndrome)\n  * creatinine \u2264 2.0 mg/dl or 177\u00b5mol/L INR \u2264 1,5\n* Patients must have the following laboratory values within normal limits or corrected to within normal limits with supplemets before the first dose of study medication:\n\n  * Sodium\n  * Potassium\n  * Total calcium\n* In case of patients of child bearing potential:\n\nNegative serum pregnancy test at baseline (within 7 days prior to randomization) and agreement to remain abstinent (if it is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle) or use single or combined non-hormonal contraceptive methods that result in a failure rate of \\< 1% per year during the treatment period and for at least 7 months after the last dose of study treatment\n\nExclusion criteria:\n\nPatients will be excluded from the study for any of the following reasons:\n\n* History of hypersensitivity reactions attributed to trastuzumab, pertuzumab, ribociclib or to other components of drug formulation\n* Mandatory need for cytostatic treatment at time of study entry based on clinical judgment and national/international treatment guidelines\n* Known CNS metastases\n* Any concurrent severe, uncontrolled systemic disease, social or psychiatric condition that might interfere with the planned treatment and with the patient's adherence to the protocol\n* Progression on prior Pertuzumab therapy\n* Treatment with Pertuzumab within the last 12 months\n* Prior treatment with any mTOR- or CDK4/6-inhibitor\n* Treatment with any other investigational agents during trial\n* Known hypersensitivity to lecithin (soya) or peanuts\n* Life expectancy \\< 6 months\n* Patients with pre-existing grade \u22652 peripheral neuropathy are excluded from taxane-based chemotherapy\n* History of serious cardiac disease, including but not confined to:\n\n  * history of documented heart failure or systolic dysfunction (LVEF \\< 50%)\n  * high-risk uncontrolled arrhythmias i.e., atrial tachycardia with a heart rate \u2265100/min at rest, significant ventricular arrhythmia (ventricular tachycardia) or higher-grade AV-block (second degree AV-block Type 2 \\[Mobitz 2\\] or third degree AV-block)\n  * angina pectoris requiring anti-anginal medication\n  * clinically significant valvular heart disease\n  * evidence of transmural infarction on ECG\n  * poorly controlled hypertension (e.g., systolic \\>180 mm Hg or diastolic \\>100 mm Hg)\n  * any other cardiac condition, which in the opinion of the treating physician would make this protocol unreasonably hazardous for the patient\n* Dyspnea at rest or other diseases that require continuous oxygen therapy\n* Patients with poorly controlled diabetes or with evidence of clinically significant diabetic vascular complications\n* Patients with known infection with HIV, hepatitis B virus, or hepatitis C virus\n* Male patients\n* Pregnant, lactating or women of childbearing potential without a negative pregnancy test (serum) within 7 days prior to randomization, irrespective of the method of contraception used\n* Medical or psychological conditions that would not permit the subject to complete the study or sign informed consent\n* Participation in another clinical study within the 30 days before registration\n* Legal incapacity or limited legal capacity",
