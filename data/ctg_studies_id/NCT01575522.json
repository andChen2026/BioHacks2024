the invasive tumor must be hormone-receptor poor, defined as estrogen-receptor negative (ER-) and progesterone-receptor negative (PR-), or staining \\< 10% by immunohistochemistry (IHC)\n\n  * Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) status: the invasive tumor must be HER2-negative, defined as 0 or 1+ by IHC, or FISH \\< 2.0\n* Women of child-bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) during the study and for 90 days after the last investigational drug dose received\n* Female subjects of childbearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test within 21 days of cycle 1 day 1\n* Participants on bisphosphonates may continue receiving bisphosphonate therapy during study treatment; bisphosphonate therapy may also be initiated on study treatment if needed\n* Confirmed availability of formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tumor tissue\n* Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Participants who have received chemotherapy, biologic, investigational, or radiotherapy within 14 days prior to entering the study\n* Participants who are receiving any other investigational agents\n* Known brain metastases that are untreated, symptomatic, or require therapy to control symptoms\n\n  * Participants with a history of treated central nervous system (CNS) metastases are eligible\n\n    * Treated brain metastases are defined as those having no evidence of progression or hemorrhage for \\>= 2 months after treatment, and no ongoing requirement for corticosteroids, as ascertained by clinical examination and brain imaging (magnetic resonance imaging or computed tomography \\[CT\\] scan) during the screening period\n    * Treatment for brain metastases may include whole-brain radiotherapy, radiosurgery, or a combination as deemed appropriate by the treating physician\n  * Participants may be taking anti-convulsant medications, which must be non-enzyme-inducing anti-epileptic drugs\n* History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic composition to ARQ 197\n* History of congestive heart failure defined as Class II to IV per New York Heart Association (NYHA) classification;
