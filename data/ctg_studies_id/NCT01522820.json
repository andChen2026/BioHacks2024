    "eligibilityCriteria": "Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Patients with any solid tumors at high risk of recurrence or with minimal residual disease; there may or may not be measurable or symptomatic disease (i.e., patients with bladder, brain, breast, esophageal, gastrointestinal, hepatocellular, kidney, lungs, melanoma, ovarian, prostate, sarcomas, and uterine)\n* Cancer types:\n\n  * Prostate cancer: patients with metastatic, castrate refractory prostate cancer; the use of luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) agonist is allowed\n  * Kidney cancer: patients with metastatic kidney cancer; prior therapies with cytokines, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and mechanistic target of rapamycin (serine/threonine kinase) (mTOR) inhibitors are allowed\n  * Bladder cancer: patients with metastatic urothelial carcinoma; prior cisplatin-based therapies are allowed\n  * Ovarian cancer: eligible patients may have asymptomatic residual measurable disease on physical examination and/or computed tomography (CT) scan, and/or may have an elevated cancer antigen (CA)-125; or may be in complete clinical remission after treatment for primary or recurrent disease\n  * Brain tumors: histologic proof of one of the following: glioblastoma multiforme, anaplastic astrocytoma, anaplastic oligodendroglioma or anaplastic mixed glioma or anaplastic oligoastrocytoma; patients who have had recent cranial surgery are eligible for inclusion, but the vaccine may not be administered prior to postoperative day 14\n  * Uterine cancer: patients with advanced (stages II-IV) or recurrent disease who have completed standard therapy, currently no evidence of disease (NED) or with minimal residual disease; patients with stage I uterine serous carcinomas or sarcomas are also eligible after completion of standard therapy\n  * Breast cancer: patients can enter study after completion of all chemotherapy (including trastuzumab), radiation, and breast/axillary surgery; patients may participate while on endocrine therapy; stages I-III patients with the following characteristics:\n\n    * Estrogen-receptor (ER) negative with positive lymph nodes; ER negative with negative nodes if tumor \\> 2 cm; ER positive with positive lymph nodes; and ER positive with negative lymph nodes and tumor \\> 5 cm\n  * Sarcomas: patients with sarcomas of any site, who have completed standard therapy, and are in remission, or have minimal disease burden\n  * Lungs: resected patients with hilar or ipsilateral mediastinal nodal disease (i.e., a subset of patients with stage II and IIIA disease); and patients with residual disease on imaging after definitive radiation or chemoradiation therapy\n  * Esophageal: resected patients with any nodal (i.e., thoracic or abdominal) disease; and patients with residual disease on imaging after definitive chemoradiation therapy\n  * Melanoma: stage IIB, stage IIC, and stage III who have completed planned definitive therapy for their disease including radiotherapy and/or interferon; patients declining interferon or with contra-indications to interferon will also be eligible provided they meet requisite criteria for this study (i.e., non-measurable disease); stage IV melanoma of M1a sub-type only, who are not candidates for additional therapy of curative potential (i.e., small volume disease; may be measurable or evaluable); and stage IV melanoma, NED, status post (s/p) complete resection of known sites of disease (i.e., non-measurable disease)\n  * Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC): patients who have been treated with surgical resection for HCC;
