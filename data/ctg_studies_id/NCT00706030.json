Subjects who relapsed under adjuvant treatment shouldn't have received more than one line of chemotherapy for metastatic disease (part 2 only).\n* Prior treatment with vinorelbine for metastatic setting, or prior treatment with any ErbB-2 targeted agents except trastuzumab (part 2 only). Up to 20 subjects with ErbB-2-overexpressing metastatic breast cancer who have been previously exposed to lapatinib but are not refractory to lapatinib may be enrolled in part 2.\n* Prior treatment with anthracyclines with a cumulative dose of doxorubicin of greater than 400 mg/m2, or of epirubicin dose of greater than 800 mg/m2, or the equivalent dose for other anthracyclines or derivatives (part 2 only).",
