Any clinical signs or symptoms of symptomatic brain metastasis or visceral metastasis (at least one of the following: carcinomatous meningitis or leptomeningeal metastasis; pleural effusion; ascites; abdominal pain caused by liver or peritoneal metastasis; dyspnea caused by pleural effusion or pulmonary lymphangitis; elevated liver enzymes (\\> 2 \u00d7 ULN); rapid elevation of bilirubin \\> 1.5 \u00d7 ULN in the absence of Gilbert's syndrome or biliary obstruction; pathologically confirmed bone marrow metastasis; hemoglobin less than 10 g) and patients who cannot tolerate chemotherapy or are considered by the investigator to be inappropriate for chemotherapy or chemotherapy.\n4. Adequate bone marrow function. Definitions are as follows: a) neutrophil count (ANC) \u2265 1,500/mm3 (1.5 x 109L) (14 without growth factors); b) platelet count (PLT) \u2265 100,000/mm3 (100 x 109L) (7 without correction); c) hemoglobin (Hb) \u2265 8 g/dL (80 g/L) (7 without correction).\n5. Female subjects who are not postmenopausal or surgically sterile must have a serum pregnancy test within 7 days before the first dose and have a negative result, and are willing to abstain from sexual intercourse or use a medically recognized highly effective contraceptive measure after signing the informed consent, during the study, and for 1 year after administration of the study drug.\n6. Voluntarily participate in this study, sign informed consent, have good compliance and are willing to cooperate with follow-up.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n1. Patients contraindicated with dalpiciclib.\n2. Patients with primary resistance to endocrine therapy. Relapse within 2 years of adjuvant endocrine therapy, or disease progression within 6 months of advanced first-line endocrine therapy.\n3. Patients with more than 3 lines of prior endocrine therapy.\n4. Patients previously treated with any CDK4/6 inhibitor.\n5. Patients with simple bone metastasis.\n6.
