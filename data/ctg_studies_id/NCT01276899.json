Known infection with HIV or hepatitis\n\nMetastatic setting\n\n1. Patients with ER+, PR+ or HER2+ tumors demonstrated by local standards\n2. Inadequate or unusable tissue as the only tissue available for biopsy\n3. Other non-malignant systemic disease to preclude treatment with standard chemotherapy regimen or prevent follow-up\n4. Abnormal coagulation profile\n5. The planned concurrent administration of therapies (e.g. palliative radiotherapy) that target metastatic sites accessible for biopsy\n6. Known infection with HIV or hepatitis",
