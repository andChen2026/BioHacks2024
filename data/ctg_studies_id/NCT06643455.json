The following which are allowed: HER2-targeted therapies, CDK4/6 inhibitor (abemaciclib or ribociclib), endocrine therapy (aromatase inhibitors, ovarian suppression therapy, and tamoxifen), PARP inhibitors (olaparib), and zolendronic acid.\n\n  * Rationale: these treatments are allowed as the majority of early stage breast cancer survivors receive at least one of these therapies for one or more years following diagnosis; our goal is to test this intervention in a population where the findings will be generalizable to a large population of breast cancer survivors).\n* Access to phone for study contacts.\n* Access to smartphone, tablet, or computer and internet to attend online program.\n* Willing and able to complete all study activities after randomization, including completing surveys online, at-home, and over the telephone assessments.\n* Able to understand and willing to sign written informed electronic (e) consent in English (note: though Dr. Greenlee's research group has conducted many trials in Spanish-speaking populations, we did not have the funding to develop and test the intervention in the Spanish language; should the MIND program show evidence of preliminary efficacy we will seek funding to develop and test the intervention in Spanish.).\n* Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) status of 0-2.\n* Participants must not be actively smoking within the past 30 days. Active smoking is defined as any smoking, even a puff. Participants who smoke are much less likely to engage in healthy lifestyle behaviors, and it is probably more important for participants to stop smoking than it is to change their dietary patterns. If identified as actively smoking, the individual will be referred to the local resources, Washington State Quitline (1-800-QUIT-NOW), ICanQuit.org, Quit2Heal.org, the national resource, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) \"Quit Now\" phone line which supports smoking cessation, or the NIH quit support website \"SmokeFree.gov.\n* Participants must consume \\< 5 servings of fruits and vegetables per day as assessed by a brief questionnaire.\n* Physician approval to participate in the MIND program dietary intervention.\n* At the time of enrollment, women must not be pregnant or lactating or planning to become pregnant in the next 6 months.",
