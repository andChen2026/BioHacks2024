Patient who completed surgery for his breast cancer and for which definitive histo-pathological analysis of surgical specimen is available.\n3. Invasive breast carcinoma pN0 or pN(i+) with histological tumor size \u2264 10 mm (pT1a/b subgroup) or invasive breast carcinoma with histological tumor size \\> 10 mm and \u2264 30 mm (pT1c T2 \u2264 30 mm control group).\n4.

Patients with any previous malignancy of the breast or other site, with the exception of adequately treated basal or squamous cell carcinoma, non-melanomatous skin cancer totally resected.\n2. Non-invasive breast carcinoma (i.e. ductal carcinoma in situ exclusively).\n3. Inoperable breast invasive carcinoma.\n4. Synchronous bilateral breast cancer.\n5. Patients who received neo-adjuvant treatment (radiotherapy or chemotherapy or other before surgery).\n6. Pregnant or breast-feeding women.\n7. Any psychological, familial, geographic or social situation, according to the judgment of investigator, potentially preventing the provision of informed consent or compliance to study procedure.\n8.
