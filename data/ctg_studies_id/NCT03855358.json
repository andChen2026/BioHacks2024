Negative of ER and PR is defined as expression of ER,PR\\<1% of the tumor cells by immunohistochemistry (IHC). HER2-negative is defined as a score of 0 and 1+ by IHC, or IHC 2+ \\& fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH)negative. If the ER2 test result is 0 or 1+ by IHC, FISH detection is optional, but the result must be negative.\n\n3\u3001Patients had at least one measurable lesion (RECIST 1.1); 4\u3001Participants has received prior anthracyclines and/or taxanes in first-line therapy.
