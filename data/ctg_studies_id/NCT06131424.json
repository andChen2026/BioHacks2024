Provision of informed consent by the patient or next of kin/legal representative (for deceased patients at study entry, unless a waiver was granted) according to local regulations 3. Must have a histological or cytological confirmed previous diagnosis as HER2-negative (IHC zero, 1+, 2+/ISH-) locally-advanced or mBC between 01 January 2019 and 31 December 2022, regardless of HR status 4. Must have progressed on any systemic anticancer therapy (eg, ET, chemotherapy, CDK4/6 inhibitor, targeted therapies other than anti-HER2, or immunotherapy) in the metastatic setting with the availability of at least 12 months of follow-up data (from the index date) in the medical records at the participating site, unless patient died within the first 12 months of diagnosis a) The HR positive patients will be considered eligible for the study if they have received ET as adjuvant therapy in the early BC setting and progressed within 24 months, this scenario will be considered as progression on systematic treatment in the advanced or metastatic setting 5. Must have historical IHC-stained FFPE tissue from locally-advanced or mBC slides for HER2 in an acceptable quality to allow for accurate rescoring of HER2 expression - Exclusion Criteria:1. Have a history of other malignancies, other than basal cell carcinoma of the skin and squamous cell carcinoma of the skin until 3 years prior to diagnosis of locally-advanced or mBC 2. Patients with historical HER2 status of IHC 2+/ISH+ or 3+, or HER2 amplified\n\n-",
