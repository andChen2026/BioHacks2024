Seasonal influenza vaccines for injection are generally inactivated flu vaccines and are allowed. Intranasal influenza vaccines (e.g. FluMist) are live attenuated vaccines and are not allowed. Replication-incompetent viral, mRNA, subunit, conjugate, and toxoid vaccines are allowed.\n* COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic consideration: The COVID-19 vaccination should not be delayed; however, caution should be exercised when combining vaccination with cancer therapy, particularly immunotherapy. The COVID-19 vaccines can cause transient lymphadenopathy and potentially impact assessment of disease burden during screening and/or on-study. To allow correct interpretation and reduce equivocal findings, investigators should discuss with the participant appropriate timing and selection of anatomic site of vaccination (alternative) with respect to imaging scans (MRI or CT). Screening scans should be acquired before the first dose of a COVID-19 vaccine or 4-6 weeks after the second dose of the vaccine. Because cancer patients are considered vulnerable population, after COVID-19 vaccination there is also a potential for heightened immune related adverse events including CRS. Investigators should use judgement when evaluating and managing potentially overlapping adverse events and in establishing causality with the study treatment (Sch\u00f6nrich and Raftery 2019; Desai et al. 2021; Edmonds et al. 2021; Indini et al. 2021)\n\nFor the pembrolizumab combination therapy cohort ONLY:\n\n* Experienced \u2265 Grade 3 immune related adverse events while on immunotherapy prior to enrollment\n* Have not recovered from Grade 2 immune related adverse events attributed to immunotherapy to Grade 1 or baseline prior to enrollment.\n* NSCLC with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) or anaplastic lymphoma receptor tyrosine kinase (ALK) genomic tumor alterations\n* Isolated intracranial relapse\n* Interstitial lung disease or active, non-infectious pneumonitis\n* Signs and symptoms consistent with clinically significant, decreased pulmonary function: (1) blood saturation oxygen level (SpO2) \\< 90% at rest on room air; (2) dyspnea at rest (CTCAE v. 5.0 \u2265 Grade 3) or supplemental oxygen used to maintain adequate oxygenation within 14 days prior to the planned first dose of investigational product\n* Ongoing immune-related toxicity or immune-related toxicity requiring systemic corticosteroids for 30 or more consecutive days for a prior immune related adverse event before initiation of study treatment\n\nFor the PLD combination therapy cohort ONLY:\n\n\u2022Prior drug-induced cardiotoxicity, defined as a sustained decrease in the ejection fraction (EF) of \\> 15%.",
