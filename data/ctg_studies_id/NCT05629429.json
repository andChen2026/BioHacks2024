More than 2 prior lines of cytotoxic chemotherapy for metastatic disease.\n\n   1. Prior treatments with hormonal therapy and non hormonal targeted therapy are allowed and not counted as a prior line of cytotoxic chemotherapy.\n   2. For the purposes of this protocol, the combination of \"an aromatase inhibitor and everolimus\" or \"a hormonal therapy and CDK4/6 inhibitor\" is not considered cytotoxic chemotherapy.\n   3. Treatment with biologics will not be considered as prior line of therapy.\n   4. Patients receiving any systemic chemotherapy or radiotherapy (except for palliative reasons) within 3 weeks prior to study treatment\n3.
