If so a second serum pregnancy test will be done. Volunteers will be asked to use barrier contraception during study.\n* Tamoxifen or other preventive measures within 6 months\n* Serious Psychiatric condition or addictive disorder\n* Diabetes or elevated fasting blood sugar\n* Inability to inject medication or test for finger stick glucose\n* Symptomatic gallstones or known gall bladder disease\n* History of cholecystitis without cholecystectomy\n* Electrolyte abnormalities (particularly hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia)\n\nQT related exclusion criteria\n\n* QTcF at screening \\> 450 msec.\n* History of syncope or family history of idiopathic sudden death.\n* Sustained or clinically significant cardiac arrhythmias.\n* Risk factors for Torsades de Pointes such as hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, cardiac failure, clinically significant/symptomatic bradycardia, or high-grade AV block.\n* Concomitant disease(s) that could prolong QT such as autonomic neuropathy (caused by diabetes, or Parkinson's disease), HIV, cirrhosis, uncontrolled hypothyroidism or cardiac failure\n* Concomitant medication(s) known to increase the QT interval.",
