Liver function: total bilirubin (TBIL\u22641.5 ULN), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) was \u22642.5 ULN in all patients, and AST and ALT were \u2264 in patients with liver metastasis 5.0 ULN;\n   4.

Toxicity from previous antineoplastic therapy has returned to grade 1 or less as defined by NCI-CTCAE v5.0 (investigator review) concerns about asymptomatic laboratory abnormalities such as elevated ALP, hyperuricemia, hyperglycemia, etc., and investigators toxicity without safety risk was judged, such as alopecia, grade 2 peripheral neurotoxicity, or decreased hemoglobin but \u226590g/L except).\n10. A pregnancy test should be performed within 7 days of starting treatment for premenopausal women who are likely to have children clear or urine pregnancy tests must be negative and must be non-lactating; All enrolled patients should be in the entire treatment week adequate barrier contraceptive measures were taken at the end of treatment and 6 months after the end of treatment.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n1.

Patients with central nervous system (CNS) metastases and/or carcinomatous meningitis (meningeal metastases). Patients who had received treatment for brain metastases (radiotherapy or surgery; Patients with stable brain metastases who had stopped radiotherapy or surgery 28 days before the first dose were eligible. Patients with cancerous meningitis (meningeal metastasis) were excluded even if they were treated and judged to be stable. Stability is defined as meeting the following four criteria:\n\n    1. seizure-free status for \\> 12 weeks with or without antiepileptic medication;\n    2. no need for corticosteroids;\n    3. stable on two consecutive MRI scans (at least 4 weeks apart);\n    4. stable and asymptomatic for more than one month after treatment.\n13.
