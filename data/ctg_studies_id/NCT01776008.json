NOTE: fine needle aspiration (FNA) of axillary lymph node is acceptable\n* Invasive cancer or DCIS in the contralateral breast\n* Receiving any medications or substances that are strong inhibitors or inducers of cytochrome P450, family 3, subfamily A, polypeptide 4 (CYP450 3A4);\n\n  * NOTE: oxidative metabolism of MK-2206 in human liver microsomes is catalyzed primarily by CYP3A4, although direct glucuronidation also occurs; at least 7 days washout period is required in patients who were previously taking strong inhibitors or inducers of CYP.450 3A4; patients who are currently taking moderate inhibitors or inducers of CYP450 3A4 are encouraged to switch to other medications that do not interact with CYP450 3A4\n* Corrected QT interval (QTc) prolongation (defined as a QTc interval \\> 480 msec) or other significant electrocardiogram (ECG) abnormalities\n* Receiving any medications or substances with risk of torsades de pointes; Note: medications or substances on the list \"Drugs with Risk of Torsades de Pointes\" are prohibited; medications or substances on the list \"Drugs with Possible or Conditional Risk of Torsades de Pointes\" may be used while on study with extreme caution and careful monitoring\n* Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to:\n\n  * Ongoing or active infection\n  * Symptomatic congestive heart failure\n  * Unstable angina pectoris\n  * Uncontrolled symptomatic cardiac arrhythmia\n  * Psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements\n* Any of the following:\n\n  * Pregnant women\n  * Nursing women\n  * Women of childbearing potential who are unwilling to employ adequate contraception\n  * NOTE: breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated with MK-2206; women of childbearing potential must use two forms of contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry and for the duration of study participation\n* Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive patients on combination antiretroviral therapy; NOTE: HIV-positive patients on combination antiretroviral therapy are ineligible; in addition, these patients are at increased risk of lethal infections when treated with marrow-suppressive therapy\n* Evidence of inflammatory cancer (clinical presentation of skin erythema involving more than one third of the breast or pathological evidence of dermal lymphatic involvement)\n* Patients with known metastatic disease are excluded\n* Current use of therapeutic anticoagulation therapy\n* Previous excisional biopsy of the breast cancer\n* Any condition (e.g., gastrointestinal tract disease resulting in an inability to take oral medication or a requirement for intravenous \\[IV\\] alimentation, prior surgical procedures affecting absorption) that impairs patients ability to swallow MK-2206 tablets",
