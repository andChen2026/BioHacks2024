Adequate renal function: serum creatinine \u2264 1.5 mg/dL or creatinine clearance \u2265 50 mL/min\n13. Adequate ionic balance: potassium, total calcium (corrected for serum albumin), magnesium, sodium and phosphorus within normal limits for the institution or corrected to within normal limits with supplements before first dose of study medication\n14. Women of child-bearing potential must agree to use an effective contraceptive method while on treatment and for 8 weeks after study drugs discontinuation. Highly effective contraception methods are detailed in section 6.1.1.\n15. Patient must be affiliated to a Social Security system\n16. Patient information and written informed consent form signed\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n1. Patient has been pre-treated by CDK inhibitor or capecitabine\n2. Patient has a DPD deficiency\n3. Patient has a known hypersensitivity to to 5-FU or to any of the excipients of ribociclib or capecitabine\n4. Patients with central nervous system (CNS) involvement unless they meet ALL of the following criteria:\n\n   * At least 4 weeks from prior therapy completion (including radiation and/or surgery) to starting the study treatment\n   * Clinically stable CNS tumor at the time of screening and not receiving steroids and/or enzyme-inducing anti-epileptic medications for brain metastases\n5.

Patients with concurrent severe and/or uncontrolled concurrent medical conditions that would, in the investigator's judgement, cause unacceptable safety risks, contraindicate the participation in the study or compromise compliance with the protocol (e.g., uncontrolled hypertension and/or uncontrolled diabetes mellitus, clinically significant pulmonary disease, clinically significant neurological disorder, chronic pancreatitis, chronic active hepatitis, active untreated or uncontrolled fungal, bacterial or viral infections, etc.)\n12.
