Patient's fibroadenoma size as determined by ultrasound imaging: the longest diameter is limited to 25 mm. Women of childbearing potential must have a negative urine pregnancy test within 72 hours prior to HIFU treatment. Patient must be able to understand the nature and the extent of the study and the procedures required and be willing and able to complete the screening and study procedures. Patient must give written informed consent (personally signed and dated) before completing any study-related procedure.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Patient who is pregnant or breast-feeding.\n* Patient with history of ipsilateral breast cancer within 5 years prior to study inclusion or radio therapy to the target breast within 5 years prior to study inclusion.\n* Patient with implant on the treated breast.\n* Patient with target fibroadenoma pre-treated by cryoablation or interstitial laser therapy within 12 month before recruiting for HIFU.\n* Patient's fibroadenoma not clearly visible on the ultrasound images (in B mode) at the inclusion visit.
