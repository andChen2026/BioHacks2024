Postmenopausal status is defined either by: prior bilateral oophorectomy, age \u226560 or age \\<60 and amenorrheic for 12 or more months in the absence of chemotherapy, tamoxifen, toremifene, or ovarian suppression and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and estradiol in the postmenopausal range per local normal range.\n* Participant has a histologically and/or cytologically confirmed diagnosis of ER+ and/or PgR+ breast cancer by local laboratory.\n* Participant has HER2-negative breast cancer defined as a negative in situ hybridization test or an IHC status of 0, 1+ or 2+. If IHC is 2+, a negative in situ hybridization (Fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH), Chromogenic in situ hybridization (CISH), or Silver-enhanced in situ hybridization (SISH)) test is required by local laboratory testing.\n* Participant has at least one measurable lesion as per RECIST v1.1 criteria as assessed by Investigator (a lesion at a previously irradiated site may only be counted as a target lesion if there is clear sign of progression since the irradiation).\n* Participant has recurrence or progression of disease during or after combined AI (i.e. letrozole, anastrozole, exemestane) and CDK4/6 inhibitor therapy. The combined AI and CDK4/6 inhibitor therapy does not need to be the latest treatment regimen (including adjuvant setting).\n* Participant has received \u22642 prior lines of systemic therapies overall in the metastatic setting, of which a maximum of 1 line of prior treatment with chemotherapy (except for neoadjuvant/ adjuvant chemotherapy).\n* Participant must show the presence of a PIK3CA mutation(s) determined in tumor tissue prior ro enrollment either by a Novartis designated laboratory or in tumor tissue or plasma ctDNA by a local laboratory using a Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved PIK3CA Companion Diagnostics (CDx) test for alpelisib or the CE-IVD QIAGEN Therascreen\u00ae PIK3CA RGQ PCR test.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Participant with symptomatic visceral disease that makes the participant ineligible for endocrine therapy (ET) per the investigator's best judgment.\n* Participant who relapsed with documented evidence of progression more than 12 months from completion of (neo)adjuvant endocrine/endocrine-based therapy with no treatment for metastatic disease\n* Participant has received prior treatment with fulvestrant, any oral selective estrogen receptor degrader (SERDs), any Phosphatidylinositol-3-Kinase (PI3K), mammalian Target of Rapamycin (mTOR) or Protein Kinase B (AKT) inhibitor\n\nOther Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria do apply",
