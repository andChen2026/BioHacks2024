Patient will require the use of tissue-equivalent bolus during radiation treatment or double treatment of junctions of radiation treatment fields\n4. Patient will require treatment to the internal mammary chain lymph node bed using a separate radiation electron field\n5. Patient is planned for partial-breast irradiation or Mammo-site treatment.\n6. Patient has unhealed wound or rash in the radiation field\n7. Patient has allergy to RadiaPlexRx or aloe vera\n8. Patient has systemic lupus erythematosus or scleroderma that increases the risk of radiation dermatitis development\n9. Patient will receive concurrent chemotherapy with radiation.
