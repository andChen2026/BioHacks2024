The QTc should be based on either a single Electrocardiogram (ECG) or an average of 3 sequential ECGs obtained within 24 hours of each other.\n* The QTc should be based on single or averaged QTc values of triplicate ECGs obtained over a brief recording period.\n* Women of childbearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test within 7 days prior to the first dose of study treatment and agree to use effective contraception, during the study and for 30 days following the last dose of study treatment.\n* Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1\n* Completion of screening and baseline assessments\n* Able to swallow and retain orally administered medication and does not have any clinically significant gastrointestinal abnormalities that may alter absorption such as malabsorption syndrome or major resection of the stomach or bowels.\n* At least 4 weeks must have elapsed since the last surgery and 2 weeks must have elapsed since radiotherapy\n* Adequate baseline organ function as defined below\n* Screening laboratory values should be used to confirm subject eligibility. Laboratory results may be retested if necessary to confirm eligibility.\n* Hematologic(These values must be independent of growth factor support and stable for at least one week post transfusion)\n* Absolute neutrophil count \\>=1.5 x 10\\^9/litre (L)\n* Hemoglobin \\>=9.0 grams/decilitre(g/dL) (after transfusion if needed)\n* Platelets\\>=100 x 10\\^9/L\n* Hepatic\n* Albumin \\>=2.5 g/dL\n* Serum bilirubin \\<=1.25 x upper limit of normal (ULN)( These values must be independent of growth factor support and stable for at least one week post transfusion)\n* Alanine aminotransferase; and, Aspartate aminotransferase AST and ALT\\<=2.5 x ULN\n* Renal\n* Calculate creatinine clearance \\>=40 millilitre/ minute (mL/min) (With the exception of those subjects who have Gilbert's syndrome; the bilirubin in these subjects should be at their baseline)\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Lactating female\n* Note: Women with potential to have children must be willing to practice acceptable methods of birth control during the study\n* Bone-only disease and/or disease that cannot be biopsied.\n* Unstable CNS metastases or leptomeningeal carcinomatosis not considered radiographically stable\n* Note: Subjects with radiographically stable CNS metastases are defined as radiographically stable on the previous 2 brain imaging studies, asymptomatic, and off systemic steroids and anticonvulsants for at least 1 month; treatment with prophylactic anticonvulsants is permitted unless listed under prohibited medications\n* Any serious and/or unstable pre-existing medical, psychiatric disorder, or other conditions including concurrent disease that could interfere with subject's safety, obtaining informed consent, or compliance with the study procedures.\n* Serious cardiac illness or medical condition including but not confined to: Uncontrolled arrhythmias (e.g. ventricular tachycardia, high-grade atrioventricular (AV)-block, supraventricular arrhythmias which are not adequately rate-controlled);\n* Angina pectoris requiring antianginal medication\n* History of congestive heart failure or systolic dysfunction (LVEF \\<50%)\n* Documented myocardial infarction \\<6 months from study entry\n* Evidence of transmural infarction on ECG\n* Poorly controlled hypertension (e.g. systolic \\>160milimiter (mm) Mercury (Hg) or diastolic \\>100mm Hg)\n* Clinically significant valvular heart disease\n* Current active hepatic or biliary disease (with exception of subjects with Gilbert's syndrome, asymptomatic gallstones, liver metastases, or stable chronic liver disease per investigator assessment)\n* Any clinically significant gastrointestinal abnormalities that may alter absorption such as malabsorption syndrome or major resection of the stomach or bowels as well as subjects with ulcerative colitis are also excluded\n* Any prohibited medication\n* Prior treatment with Trastuzumab in combination with Lapatinib or prior treatment with an irreversible inhibitor of the intracellular domain of the HER2 receptor such as neratinib\n* Last treatment for metastatic disease including Trastuzumab in combination with pertuzumab\n* Administration of an investigational drug within 30 days or 5 half-lives, whichever is longer, preceding the first dose of study treatment\n* A known immediate or delayed hypersensitivity reaction or idiosyncrasy to drugs chemically related to any of the study drugs or their excipients that, in the opinion of the investigator or medical monitor, contraindicates participation",
