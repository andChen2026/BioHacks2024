    "eligibilityCriteria": "Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Patients must have HER2-positive Stage II or III histologically confirmed invasive carcinoma of the breast. A minimum tumor size of 2 cm determined by physical exam or imaging is required.\n* HER-2 positive, confirmed by central testing (Clarient labs): IHC 3+ and/or FISH positive based on one of the three following criteria:\n* Single-probe average HER2 copy number\u22656.0 signals/cell OR\n* Dual-probe HER2/CEP17 \\<2.0 with an average HER2 copy number \u22656.0 signals/cell OR\n* Dual-probe HER2/CEP17 ratio \u22652.0\n* ER/PR determination is required.\n* Bilateral breast cancers are allowed if both cancers are HER2-positive.\n* Patients with multifocal or multicentric disease are eligible as long as one area meets eligibility criteria.\n* Breast imaging should include the ipsilateral axilla. For subjects with a clinically negative axilla, a sentinel lymph node biopsy will be performed either before or after preoperative therapy at the discretion of the subject's physicians. For subjects with a clinically positive axilla, a needle aspiration, core biopsy or SLN procedure will be performed to determine the presence of metastatic disease in the lymph nodes.\n* Men and women (with any menopausal status) \u2265 18 years of age\n* ECOG performance status 0 or 1\n* Required laboratory values:\n\n  * ANC \u22651500/mm3\n  * Hemoglobin \u2265 9 g/dl\n  * Platelets \u2265100,000/mm3\n  * Serum creatinine \\< 1.5 X ULN (institutional)\n  * Total bilirubin \u2264 1.0 X ULN (institutional) For patients with Gilbert syndrome, the direct bilirubin should be within the institutional normal range.\n  * AST and ALT \u2264 1.5x ULN (institutional)\n  * Alkaline phosphatase \u22641.5x ULN (institutional)\n* Documentation of hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) serologies is required: this includes hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and/or total hepatitis B core antibody (HBcAb) in addition to HCV antibody testing.\n* Only for patients who test positive for hep B/C virus: PTT/INR \\< ULN (institutional)\n* Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) \u2265 55%\n* Premenopausal women must have a negative serum pregnancy test, including women who have had a tubal ligation and for women less than 12 months after the onset of menopause.\n* Women of childbearing potential and men with partners of childbearing potential must be willing to use one highly effective form of non-hormonal contraception or two effective forms of non-hormonal contraception by the patient and/or partner and continue its use for the duration of the study treatment and for 7 months after the last dose of study treatment.\n* Potent CYP3A4 inhibitors, such as ketoconazole and erythromycin, should be avoided during the study treatment period with T-DM1.\n* Excessive alcohol intake should be avoided (occasional use is permitted).\n* Patients with a history of ipsilateral DCIS are eligible.\n* Patients undergoing breast conservation therapy (i.e. lumpectomy) must not have any contraindications to radiation therapy.\n* Willing and able to sign informed consent.\n* Willing to provide tissue for research purposes.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Pregnant or nursing women due to the teratogenic potential of the study drugs.\n* Active, unresolved infection.\n* Receipt of intravenous antibiotics for infection within 7 days prior to enrollment.\n* Patients with active liver disease, for example, due to hepatitis B virus, hepatitis C virus, autoimmune hepatic disorder, or sclerosing cholangitis.\n* Uncontrolled hypertension (systolic \\>180 mm Hg and/or diastolic \\>100 mm Hg) or clinically significant (i.e. active) cardiovascular disease: cerebrovascular accident/stroke or myocardial infarction within 6 months prior to first study medication, unstable angina, congestive heart failure (CHF) of New York Heart Association (NYHA) Grade II or higher, or serious cardiac arrhythmia requiring medication.\n* Significant symptoms (Grade \u22652) peripheral neuropathy.\n* Other concurrent serious diseases that may interfere with planned treatment, including severe pulmonary conditions/illness, uncontrolled infections, uncontrolled diabetes.\n* Any prior treatment for the current breast cancer, including chemotherapy, hormonal therapy, radiation or experimental therapy.",
