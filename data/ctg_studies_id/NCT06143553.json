Histologically or cytologically confirmed (local laboratory) HER2-metastatic breast cancer from recently acquired or newly acquired tumor biopsies from locally-relapsed or metastatic sites (HER2- is defined as a standard immunohistochemical (IHC) test result of 0 or 1+; Or the IHC test result is 2+ and the ISH test result is negative including FISH/CISH/SISH)\uff1b\n  5. Archival slides or newly obtained biopsy slides from metastatic or recurrent sites are available (Note: Bone lesion biopsy is not accepted);\n  6.

Adjuvant or neoadjuvant chemotherapy for early-stage disease can be considered as one of the required prior chemotherapy regimens if unresectable, locally advanced, or metastatic disease develops within 12 months after completion of the regimen.( Note: Therapies for bone metastases (e.g., bisphosphonates, denosumab, etc.) are not considered prior systemic chemotherapy for advanced disease.)\uff1b\n  7.
