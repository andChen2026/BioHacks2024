Ongoing or recent evidence of significant autoimmune disease. Patients with a history of grade 3 or higher immune-related adverse events that led to treatment discontinuation.\n   5. Patients with a prior history of myositis, Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome, or myasthenia gravis of any grade.\n   6. History of chronic liver disease or evidence of hepatic cirrhosis.\n   7. History of non-infectious pneumonitis that has required steroids, or currently has pneumonitis.\n   8. History of organ allograft (except for corneal transplant) or autologous or allogeneic bone marrow transplant, or stem cell rescue within 3 months prior to the first dose of GEN1044.\n   9. Serious, non-healing wound, skin ulcer (of any grade), or bone fracture.\n2. Any history of intracerebral arteriovenous malformation, cerebral aneurysm, new or symptomatic brain metastases or stroke.\n3. Prior therapy:\n\n   Radiotherapy: Radiotherapy within 14 days prior to first GEN1044 administration. Palliative radiotherapy will be allowed.\n4. Treatment with an anti-cancer agent (within 28 days or after at least 5 half-lives of the drug, whichever is shorter), prior to GEN1044 administration. Toxicities from previous anti-cancer therapies that have not resolved.\n5. Has a history of \u2265 grade 2 cytokine release syndrome (CRS) with other CD3-based bispecifics, or a history of \u2265 grade 3 allergic reactions to monoclonal antibody therapy as well as known or has known allergies, hypersensitivity, or intolerance to GEN1044 or its excipients.",
