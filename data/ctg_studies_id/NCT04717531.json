Histologically confirmed HER2 (human epidermal growth factor receptor-2)-positive invasive breast cancer.\n\n4. Non-objective response after 2 cycles of THP as neoadjuvant treatment. 5. Known hormone receptor status. 6. Patient has adequate bone marrow, liver, and renal function:\n\n1.

Hepatic function: total bilirubin \u2264 1.5 x institutional upper limit of normal (ULN) (except for Gilbert's syndrome); aspartate transaminase (AST) and alanine transaminase (ALT) \u2264 2.5 times ULN.\n3. Renal function: serum creatinine and BUN \u2264 1.5 x ULN, or creatinine clearance \u2265 50 ml/min/1.73 m2 for patients with creatinine levels above institutional normal.\n\n8. LVEF \u226550% measured by echocardiography. 9. Fertile patients must use effective contraception (barrier method - condoms, diaphragm - also in conjunction with spermicidal jelly, or total abstinence. Oral, injectable, or implant hormonal contraceptives are not allowed).\n\n10.

Patients with a prior malignancy diagnosed more than 10 years prior to randomization may enter the study. Patients must have been curatively treated with surgery alone. Radiation therapy or systemic therapy (chemotherapy or endocrine) are NOT permitted. Prior diagnoses of breast cancer or melanoma are excluded.\n4. Concurrent treatment with an investigational agent or participation in another therapeutic clinical trial;\n5. Major surgical procedure or significant traumatic injury within 14 days prior to randomization or anticipation of the need for major surgery within the course of the study treatment.\n6.

Patients of childbearing potential must implement adequate non-hormonal contraceptive measures during study treatment.\n9. Concurrent disease or condition that would make the subject inappropriate for study participation or any serious medical disorder that would interfere with the subject's safety.",
