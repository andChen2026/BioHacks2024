Patients with metastatic or advanced cancer treated by immunotherapy as maintenance therapy can be included without any lesion at IO initiation. In this case, response after 6 months of standard immunotherapy will be evaluated by the non-appearance of a new lesion.\n5. Eligible to maintain the same standard IO treatment.\n6. Patient with Eastern cooperative oncology group (ECOG) performance status \u22641.\n7. Patients with brain metastases are allowed, provided they are stable according to the following definitions: treated with surgery or stereotactic radiosurgery and without evidence of progression prior to randomization and have no evidence of new or enlarging brain metastases.\n8. Patients treated by IO previously combined with chemotherapy are allowed.\n9. Patients with Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor (TKI)-IO or pemetrexed-IO or bevacizumab-IO are allowed.\n10. Evidence of post-menopausal status, or negative urinary or serum pregnancy test for pre-menopausal patients.\n11. Both sexually active women of childbearing potential and males (and their female partners) patients must agree to use adequate contraception method for the duration of the study treatment and after completing treatment according to the most recent version of the IO Summary of product characteristics (SmPC).\n12. Patient is willing and able to comply with the protocol for the duration of the trial including undergoing treatment and scheduled visits, and examinations including follow-up.\n13. Patient must be affiliated to a Social Security System.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n1. Metastatic melanoma in complete response.\n2. Metastatic renal cell carcinoma with International Metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma Database (IMDC) favourable-risk treated TKI/IO combination.\n3.
