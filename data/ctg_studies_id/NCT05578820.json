At least 4 weeks or at least 5 elimination half-lives must elapse between previous chemotherapy, targeted therapy, radiotherapy, immunotherapy, or experimental antitumor therapy and administration of the study drug;\n15. Patients must recover from any previous surgery, radiotherapy, localized therapy, or systemic therapy to grade 1 or lower adverse reactions (except alopecia or anemia, for which grade 2 is acceptable);\n16. Women of childbearing age (not menopausal or surgically sterilized) and men who are sexually active should use a reliable method of contraception (acceptable methods of contraception in this study are: IUDs, oral contraceptives, contraceptive patch, long-acting injectable contraceptives, dual barrier method (condom and spermicide, diaphragm and spermicide) during the study and at least 30 days after the last dose of Cymeven\u00ae for female patients and at least 90 days after the last dose of Cymeven\u00ae for male patients;\n17. Ability to follow protocol procedures throughout the study;\n18. Presence of Patient Informed Consent to Participate in a Clinical Trial.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n1. The investigator's concern that injecting the drug into the tumor mass may lead to life-threatening side effects, if tumor swelling or inflammation occurs after treatment;\n2. History of hypersensitivity to ganciclovir, valganciclovir, or any other component of Cymeven\u00ae;\n3. History of hypersensitivity to acyclovir or pencyclovir (or their prodrugs valacyclovir or famciclovir, respectively);\n4. History of allergic reactions to antibiotics;\n5. History of allergic reaction to polyethylene glycol or polyethyleneimine;\n6. The following medications are scheduled to be taken during the potential therapy period:\n\n   * imipenem/cylastatin\n   * drugs that have myelosuppressive effects or impair renal function: nucleoside analogues (e.g., zidovudine, didanosine, stavudine), immunosuppressants (e.g., cyclosporine, tacrolimus, mycophenolate mofetil), anticancer drugs (e.g, doxorubicin, vincristine, vinblastine, hydroxyurea) and anti-infective drugs (e.g., trimethoprim/sulfamides, dapsone, amphotericin B, flucytosine, pentamidine);\n   * probenecid;\n7.

Exacerbation of allergic diseases at the time of inclusion in the study;\n14. Liver function disorder;\n15. Presence of acute and acute chronic infections within the last 4 weeks before inclusion in the study (including tuberculosis, abscess, phlegmon);\n16. Exacerbations of chronic diseases of the cardiovascular, bronchopulmonary, urogenital, gastrointestinal, musculoskeletal, nervous and immune systems at the time of inclusion in the study;\n17. Presence of mental illness;\n18. A history of active primary immunodeficiency;\n19. Presence of HIV, active hepatitis B or C;\n20. Brain metastases, carcinomatous meningitis at the moment of inclusion in the study;\n21. Patient's participation in another clinical trial less than 30 days before inclusion in this study;\n22. Any condition that, in the opinion of the investigator, might interfere with adequate treatment delivery, including difficult contact with the patient (inadequate perception of information provided about the patient's condition and planned/conducted treatment, refusal to comply with recommendations).",
