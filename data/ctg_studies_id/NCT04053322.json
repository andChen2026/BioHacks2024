Postmenopausal or evidence of non-childbearing status for women of childbearing potential: negative urine or serum pregnancy test within 28 days of study treatment and confirmed prior to treatment on day 1.\n10. Woman of childbearing potential patients must agree to use adequate contraception for the duration of trial participation and up to 3 months after the last dose of olaparib.\n\n    Male patients must use a condom during treatment and for 3 months after the last dose of olaparib when having sexual intercourse with a pregnant woman or with a woman of childbearing potential. Female partners of male patients should also use a highly effective form of contraception.\n11. Patients having provided written informed consent prior to any study-related procedures.\n12. Patient is willing and able to comply with the protocol for the duration of the study.\n13. Patients must have national social insurance coverage (applicable only in France).\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n1. Patients without olaparib targetable genomic anomaly identified during the screening phase.\n2. Gene variants (class 1, 2, and 3) of unknown significant prognostic for olaparib sensitivity.\n3.

Patients having received anticancer chemotherapy or any other investigational therapy within 3 weeks prior of the study. Endocrine therapy must have been discontinued 7 or more days before Cycle 1 Day 1. Palliative radiotherapy must have been completed 14 or more days before Cycle 1 Day 1.
