If patient has known liver metastases, ALT and/or AST \u22645xULN are allowed.\n  * Renal: creatinine clearance \u226560mL/min.\n  * Prothrombin (PT) and partial thromboplastin times (PTT) \\<ULN.\n* Negative for hepatitis viruses B and C unless consistent with prior vaccination or prior infection with full recovery.\n* Patients of childbearing potential must agree to use effective contraception while on study, and for \u22653 months after last treatment.\n* Understand and sign written informed consent document. No consent by durable power of attorney.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Second malignancy - unless following curative intent therapy, has been disease free for \u22652 years with probability of recurrence \\<5%. Curatively treated early-stage squamous cell carcinoma of the skin, basal cell carcinoma of the skin, or cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) are allowed.\n* Concurrent cancer therapy.\n* Uncontrolled central nervous system (CNS) metastases, meningeal carcinomatosis, malignant seizures, or disease that causes or threatens neurologic compromise (e.g. unstable vertebral metastases).\n* History of ascites or pleural effusions, unless successfully treated.\n* Organ transplant, including allogeneic bone marrow transplant.\n* Immunosuppressive therapy including:\n\n  * Systemic corticosteroid therapy, including replacement therapy for hypoadrenalism. Inhaled or topical corticosteroids are allowed (if therapy is \\<5 days and is limited to systemic steroids as antiemetics);\n  * Cyclosporine A, tacrolimus, or sirolimus.\n* Investigational agents within 4 weeks prior to study enrollment (\u22656 weeks if treatment was long-acting agent such as monoclonal antibody).\n* Significant or uncontrolled medical illness, e.g. congestive heart failure (CHF), myocardial infarction, symptomatic coronary artery disease, significant ventricular arrhythmias within the last 6 months, or significant pulmonary dysfunction. Patients with remote history of asthma or active mild asthma may participate.\n* Active infection, including unexplained fever (\\>38.5\u00b0C).\n* Systemic autoimmune disease (e.g. systemic lupus erythematosus, active rheumatoid arthritis).\n* Known allergy to any component of GC1008.\n* Active thrombophlebitis, thromboembolism, hypercoagulability states, bleeding, or anti-coagulation therapy (including anti platelet agents i.e. aspirin, clopidogrel, ticlopidine, dipyridamole, other agents inducing long-acting platelet dysfunction). Patients with history of deep venous thrombosis are allowed if treated, completely resolved, and no treatment for \\>4months.\n* Calcium \\>11.0mg/dL (2.75mmol/L) unresponsive or uncontrolled in response to standard therapy (e.g. bisphosphonates).\n* Patients who, in the opinion of the Investigator, have significant medical or psychosocial problems, including, but not limited to:\n\n  * Other serious non-malignancy-associated conditions that may be expected to limit life expectancy or significantly increase the risk of SAEs;\n  * Conditions, psychiatric, substance abuse, or other, that, in the opinion of the Investigator, would preclude informed consent, consistent follow-up, or compliance with any aspect of the study;\n* Pregnant or nursing women.",
