In assessable mixed lesions, the measurable part must constitute at least 50% of the size of the metastasis.\n\nIf no previous images are available, the increase in bone pain in connection with the detectable, measurable osteolyses or assessable mixed metastases in the pretreatment image are regarded as progression.\n\n* Previous radiotherapy is permitted as long as the irradiated area is not the only measurable lesion\n* Estimated life expectancy of at least 12 weeks\n* Performance status of 50 or higher on the Karnofsky scale or WHO grade 0-2.\n* Age \u226518 years\n* Written informed consent of the patient\n\nExclusion criteria for the second-line therapy:\n\nPatients are not allowed to take part in the study if they meet at least one of the following criteria:\n\n* Cerebral metastasis\n* Lymphangitis carcinomatosa of the lung (\\> 50% of the lung affected)\n* Very extensive liver metastasis (in ultrasound or CT \\> 33% of the liver replaced by metastases)\n* Inflammatory mammary carcinoma\n* Other primary malignant diseases (except in situ carcinoma of the cervix or adequately treated basal cell carcinoma of the skin)\n* Patients with concomitant serious, unstable cardiac diseases (angina pectoris, arrhythmia, myocardial infarction within the last six months) or uncontrolled diabetes mellitus\n* Known hypersensitivity to components of the study medication\n* Exclusively osteoblastic or mixed bone metastases, with a lytic percentage \\< 50%, in so far as no other measurable or assessable lesions are present\n* Antihormonal pretreatment with aromatase inhibitors, megestrol acetate, medroxyprogesterone, or GnRH analogues\n* Treatment with a hormone replacement therapy\n* Taking of non-approved substances within the past 30 days and concomitant treatment with non-approved drugs\n\nPatients with the following pretreatments should not be included in the study (selection):\n\n* Previous endocrine treatment of a metastatic mammary carcinoma\n* Patients with adjuvant or neoadjuvant endocrine treatment with or without chemotherapy within the past 12 months\n* Patients with adjuvant or neo-adjuvant endocrine antiestrogen treatment for whom a recurrence occurred during or within 12 months after the end of treatment\n* Patients who received more than one regimen of a systemic chemotherapy against their advanced breast cancer\n\nOther protocol-related inclusion / exclusion criteria may apply",
