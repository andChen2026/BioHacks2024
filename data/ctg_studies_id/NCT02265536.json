In addition, clinically significant toxicities associated with any prior therapy for the primary cancer, including investigational treatments, have resolved or stabilized to Grade \u22641 toxicity \\>28 days prior to initiation of study treatment with the exception of neuropathy, which must have resolved to Grade \u22642. Continuation of a stable dose (minimum of 28 days prior to study entry) of denosumab or bisphosphonate is permitted on study.\n* Willing to undergo 1 baseline and 1 posttreatment tumor biopsy procedure.\n* Male participants: Agree to use a reliable method of birth control and to not donate sperm during the study and for at least 12 weeks following last dose of study drug or country requirements, whichever is longer.\n* Female participants: Are women of child-bearing potential who test negative for pregnancy within 7 days prior to enrollment based on a urine or serum pregnancy test and agree to use a reliable method of birth control during the study and for 12 weeks following the last dose of the study drug and also must not be breastfeeding, OR are postmenopausal women.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Have received treatment within 28 days prior to the initial dose of study drug with an investigational product or non-approved use of a drug or device (other than the study drug/device used in this study) for non-cancer indications or are concurrently enrolled in any other type of medical research judged not to be scientifically or medically compatible with this study.\n* Have serious preexisting medical conditions (left to the discretion of the investigator).\n* Have symptomatic central nervous system (CNS) malignancy or metastasis.\n* Have an active fungal, bacterial, and/or known viral infection, including human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or viral (B or C) hepatitis.\n* Have any of the following cardiovascular conditions:\n\n  * Symptomatic coronary artery disease currently or within the past 6 months,\n  * Confirmed left ventricular ejection fraction \u226450% or any cardiac insufficiency \\> New York Heart Association (NYHA) class II currently or within the past 6 months,\n  * Uncontrolled hypertension (\\>170/100 millimeter of mercury \\[mm Hg\\]) currently or within the past 7 days, or\n  * Serious cardiac arrhythmia (well-controlled atrial fibrillation is permitted) currently or within the past 6 months.\n* Have corrected QT interval of \\>500 millisecond (msec) on screening electrocardiogram (ECG).\n* Have received treatment with agents specifically targeting colony stimulating factor 1 (CSF-1) or CSF-1R, including imatinib, nilotinib, and sunitinib.",
