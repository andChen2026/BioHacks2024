Patient must have\n\n   * At least one lesion, not previously irradiated, that can be measured accurately at baseline as \u2265 10mm in the longest diameter (except lymph nodes which must have short axis \u226515mm) with CT, or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) which is suitable for accurate repeated measurements, OR\n   * lytic or mixed bone lesions in the absence of measurable disease as defined above; patients with sclerotic/osteoblastic bone lesions only in the absence of measurable disease are not eligible.\n6. Radiological or clinical evidence of recurrence or progression\n7. Triple-negative disease\n8.
