Charlson Scale \\<= 2.\n11. Estimated life expectancy of at least 5 years (irrespective of breast cancer diagnosis).\n12. The patient must be accessible for treatment and follow-up. Patients registered on this trial must be treated and followed at the participating centre which could be the Principal or a Co- investigator's site.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n1. Known hypersensitivity reaction to the compounds or incorporated substances or known dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase deficiency.\n2. Low risk patient according to risk assessment.\n3. Inadequate organ function including:\n\n   Leucocytes \\< 3,5 G/l, Platelets \\< 100 G/l , Creatinine or Bilirubin above normal limits (1,25 above upper normal limit), Creatinine-Clearance below 50 ml/min, uncompensated cardiac function, severe and relevant co-morbidity that would interact with the application of cytotoxic agents or the participation in the study.\n4. Previously or currently one of the following medical conditions:\n\n   * pre-existing motor or sensory neuropathy of a severity \\>= grade 2 by NCI-CTC criteria;\n   * history of significant neurological or psychiatric disorders including psychotic disorders, dementia or seizures that would prohibit the understanding and giving of informed consent;\n   * known or suspected congestive heart failure (\\> NYHA I) and/or coronary heart disease, angina pectoris requiring antianginal medication, previous history of myocardial infarction, evidence of transmural infarction on ECG, un- or poorly controlled arterial hypertension (i.e. BP \\>150/100 mmHg under treatment with two antihypertensive drugs), rhythm abnormalities requiring permanent treatment, clinically significant valvular heart disease;\n   * Creatinine Clearance less than 50 ml/min;\n   * another primary malignancy with an event-free survival of \\< 5 years, except curatively treated basalioma of the skin and carcinoma in situ of the cervix.\n5. Time since axillary dissection \\> 3 months.\n6. Locally advanced, non-operable breast cancer.\n7. Previous invasive breast carcinoma.\n8. Prior chemotherapy for any malignancy.\n9. Concurrent specific systemic anti-tumor treatment or treatment with experimental compounds within the last 6 months.\n10. Concurrent treatment with other tumor specific experimental drugs. Participation in another clinical trial with any investigational not marketed drug.\n11. Concurrent treatment with virostatic agents like sorivudine or analogues like brivudine, concurrent treatment with aminoglycosides, anticoagulants: heparin, warfarin as well as acetylic acid (e.g. Aspirin\u00ae) at a dose of \\> 325mg/day or clopidogrel at a dose of \\> 75 mg/day).",
