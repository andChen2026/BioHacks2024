    "eligibilityCriteria": "Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Patients must have histologically or cytologically confirmed stage IV breast carcinoma with a previous clinical diagnosis of IBC based on the presence of inflammatory changes in the involved breast, such as diffuse erythema and edema (peau d'orange), with or without an underlying palpable mass involving the majority of the skin of the breast; pathological evidence of dermal lymphatic invasion should be noted but is not required for diagnosis\n* Patients must have local or metastatic recurrence of IBC after prior surgery\n* Patients must have a metastatic tumor negative for HER2; the lack of HER2 overexpression by immunohistochemistry (IHC), is defined as 0 or 1+ where as hyperexpression is defined as 3+; if equivocal IHC, 2+, the tumor must be non-gene amplified by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) performed upon the primary tumor or metastatic lesion (ratio \\< 2 and HER2 copy number \\< 4)\n* Patients may have measurable disease, defined as at least one lesion that can be accurately measured in at least one dimension in accordance with RECIST criteria v. 1.1 OR non-measurable tumors; NOTE: Non-measurable tumors are small lesions (longest diameter \\< 10mm or pathological lymph nodes with \\>= 10 to \\< 15 mm short axis); bone lesions, leptomeningeal disease, ascites, pleural/pericardial effusions, lymphangitis cutis/pulmonitis, inflammatory breast disease, and abdominal masses (not followed by computed tomography \\[CT\\] or magnetic resonance imaging \\[MRI\\]) are considered as non-measurable\n* Patients must be in consideration for 1st line systemic therapy for recurrent IBC;

NOTE: Patients are not required to have CNS imaging prior to study entry\n* Females of childbearing potential (FOCBP) must have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test (minimum sensitivity 25 IU/L or equivalent units of human chorionic gonadotropin \\[HCG\\]) within 72 hours of registration\n\nNOTE: A FOCBP is any woman (regardless of sexual orientation, having undergone a tubal ligation, or remaining celibate by choice) who meets the following criteria:\n\n* Has not undergone a hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy\n* Has had menses at any time in the preceding 12 consecutive months (and therefore has not been naturally postmenopausal for \\> 12 months)\n\n  * FOCBP and men who are sexually active with FOCBP must agree to follow instructions for method(s) of contraception for the duration of treatment and the designated post-treatment period\n  * Patients must have the ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent prior to registration on study\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Patients must not have had chemotherapy or radiotherapy within 4 weeks prior to study registration\n* Patients who already received chemotherapy for recurrent metastatic IBC are not eligible\n* Patients who have not recovered to =\\< grade 1 from adverse events due to agents administered more than 4 weeks earlier are not eligible\n* Patients may not be receiving any other investigational agents\n* Patients who have had prior exposure to immune checkpoint inhibitors are not eligible;
