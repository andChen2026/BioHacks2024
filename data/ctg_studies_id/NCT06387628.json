    "eligibilityCriteria": "Inclusion Criteria:\n\n1. Age 18-75 years old (including boundary value), no gender limit;\n2. ECOG score 0-1;\n3. Expected survival \u22653 months;\n4. Unresectable or metastatic or postoperative recurrent, histologically confirmed advanced triple-negative breast cancer. Triple-negative breast cancer is defined as: ER, PR and HER2 are negative. ER-negative and PR-negative are defined as tumors without positive staining, the proportion of cells in all tumor cells is \\<1%; HER2-negative is defined as: HER2 (0), HER2 (1+) or HER2 (2+) detected by immunohistochemistry but negative by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH); Cohort 2 requires histological confirmation of PD-L1 CPS \u2265 1;\n5. Cohort 1 : at least one prior line at recurrence or metastasis setting with disease progression or intolerable toxicity. In this situation, patients are allowed to be enrolled: the time between the last intravenous dose of adjuvant chemotherapy and first recurrence or metastasis is \u22646 months. Cohort 2: no prior line at recurrence or metastasis setting is allowed, the time between the last intravenous dose of adjuvant chemotherapy and first recurrence or metastasis \u226512 months.;\n6. Provide sufficient fresh tissue specimens for biomarker analysis before treatment;\n7. According to RECISTv1.1 standard, there is at least 1 measurable lesion;\n8. Appropriate bone marrow and organ function before first dose :\n\n   * Bone Marrow: Platelets ( PLT ) \u2265 90 \u00d7 109 /L , absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) \u2265 1.5 \u00d7 109 /L , hemoglobin \u2265 9 g/dL ;\n   * Coagulation: INR \u2264 1.5 , APTT \u2264 1.5 \u00d7 ULN ;\n   * Liver function: Liver function is basically normal, total bilirubin \u2264 1.5 \u00d7 ULN ( total bilirubin in patients with Gilbert syndrome \u2264 3 \u00d7 ULN can be enrolled), AST and ALT \u2264 2.5 \u00d7 ULN (if there is liver metastasis, AST , ALT \u2264 5 \u00d7 ULN );\n   * Renal function: serum creatinine \u2264 1.5 \u00d7 ULN or creatinine clearance \u2265 50 mL/min (according to Cockcroft-Gault formula);\n   * Cardiac function: left ventricular ejection fraction ( LVEF ) \u2265 50% ; female QT interval ( QTcF ) \u2264 470 ms , male \u2264 450 ms .\n9. Be able to well communicate with the investigator and understand and comply with the requirements of this study.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n1. Cohort 1 : Previous use of eribulin and CCR8- targeting drugs; Cohort 2: previous use of CCR8-targeting drugs and nab-paclitaxel, unless the interval between the last dose of nab-paclitaxel in the adjuvant chemotherapy and first recurrence or metastasis is \u226512 months;\n2. Have received radiotherapy, chemotherapy, traditional Chinese medicine with anti-tumor indications, and local therapy (interventional therapy but not including tumor biopsy, ablation therapy, etc.) within 2 weeks before trial drug treatment;\n3. Adverse events from previous anti-tumor treatments have not recovered to \u2264 grade 1 according to CTCAE v5.0 (except for \u2264 grade 2 toxicities judged by the investigator to have no safety risk, such as alopecia, long-term toxicity caused by radiotherapy, etc.);\n4. Patients with known brain metastases. Those with stable brain metastases can be enrolled;\n5. Third space effusion that is clinically uncontrollable and unsuitable for enrollment;\n6. Participants with\u2265 grade 3 allergies to antibody drugs previously;\n7. Taking systemic corticosteroids (\\>10 mg daily prednisone or equivalent dose) or other systemic immunosuppressive drugs (including but not limited to prednisone, dexamethasone, cyclophosphamide, azathioprine, methotrexate , thalidomide, and anti-tumor necrosis factor drugs), topical, ocular, intra-articular, intranasal, and inhaled corticosteroids are allowed;\n8. Subjects with a known history of autoimmune diseases, including but not limited to myasthenia gravis, myositis, autoimmune hepatitis, systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, Guillain-Barre syndrome, multiplex syndrome sclerosis or glomerulonephritis, except autoimmune-related hypothyroidism treated with stable dose of hormone;\n9. Known idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, organizing pneumonia (e.g., bronchiolitis obliterans), drug-induced pneumonia, idiopathic pneumonia, interstitial lung disease, severe radiation pneumonitis, or subjects with evidence of active pneumonia by chest CT scan screening.",
