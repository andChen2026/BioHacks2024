For both male and female participants, effective methods of contraception must be used throughout the study and for three months following the last dose.\n* Ability to understand and willingness to sign a written informed consent document prior to initiation of any screening or study-specific procedures.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active infection, congenital prolonged QT syndrome, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements.\n* Uncontrolled autoimmune disease requiring active systemic treatment.\n* Known hypersensitivity reaction to the Granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) adjuvant; any known contraindication to GM-CSF.\n* Pregnant or breast feeding.\n* Known HIV-positive.\n* Known current or a history of hepatitis B or C virus, including chronic and dormant states, unless disease has been treated and confirmed cleared.\n* Major surgery within 4 weeks of initiation of study drug.\n* Current extended use of immunosuppressive agents or systemic corticosteroids. Topical, ocular, intra-articular, intranasal, inhalational corticosteroids (with minimal systemic absorption) are allowed. A brief course of corticosteroids for prophylaxis (eg., for contrast dye allergy) or for treatment of non-autoimmune conditions (eg., delayed-type hypersensitivity reaction caused by a contact allergen) is permitted.\n* Potential participant is currently on active treatment in any other clinical protocol or investigational trial that involves administration of experimental therapy and/or therapeutic devices, or investigational drug.",
