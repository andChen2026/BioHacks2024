The subjects must voluntarily sign the informed consent, and the subjects are willing and able to comply with the visits, treatment plans, laboratory assessments, and other requirements of the study.\n2. Age \u226518 years old.\n3. Patients who were diagnosed as advanced or metastatic solid tumors histologically or cytologically have failed previous standard treatments. Patient requires the treatment in the opinion of the investigator.\n4. There is at least one measurable tumor lesion (refer to RECIST 1.1), defined as the longest measurable diameter of non-lymph node lesions by imaging (CT/MRI) \u226510 mm or the short diameter of a single pathological lymph node lesion \u226515 mm; at least one evaluable tumor lesion is needed in the dose-escalation phase.\n5. With an expected survival of \u2265 12 weeks.\n6. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) score of 0 or 1 (ECOG score of 0-2 is allowed for cohort-expansion phase).\n7. The organ or bone marrow function must meet the following laboratory criteria:\n\n   1. Hematology: Absolute neutrophil count \u2265 1.5 \u00d7 109/L; hemoglobin \u2265 90 g/L; platelet count \u2265 75 \u00d7 109/L (without supportive treatment using granulocyte colony stimulating factor within 7 days before starting study treatment).\n   2. Total serum bilirubin \u2264 1.5\u00d7 upper limit of normal (ULN) (unless Gilbert syndrome is confirmed); aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) \u2264 2.5 \u00d7 ULN; ALT and AST \u2264 5.0\u00d7ULN in case of liver metastasis.\n   3. Prothrombin time (PT) \u2264 1.2 \u00d7 ULN, activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) \u2264 1.2 \u00d7 ULN; international normalized ratio (INR) \u2264 1.2 (unless the subject is receiving warfarin therapy). If the subject is taking oral anticoagulant therapy, the dose should be stable for 2 weeks; if the subject is taking oral warfarin, the subject's INR must be \u2264 2.5 without hemorrhage.\n   4. Creatinine clearance (Cr) \\> 30 mL/min (Cockcroft and Gault Equation).\n   5. Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) \u2265 40%;\n8. Previously treated toxicities have recovered to Grade 1 \\[as per NCI CTCAE 5.0 grading criteria\\] (except toxicities which have no safety risk at the discretion of the investigator, such as alopecia, neurotoxicity \u2264 Grade 2 caused by chemotherapeutic drugs, etc.).\n9. Females with childbearing potentials must be tested negative for serum pregnancy test during the screening period before receiving the first administration of IMM2520; any female patient with childbearing potential must agree to take effective contraceptive measures during the entire study and within 3 months after study completion. A patient is considered to have childbearing potential if he/she is biologically capable of having children and has a heterosexual sex life.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\nA subject meeting any of the following criteria must be excluded from the study.\n\n1. Subjects are enrolled into another clinical study continuously, unless it is an observational, non-interfering clinical study or in the follow-up period of an interfering study.\n2. Treatment with the last systemic chemotherapy within 3 weeks; treatment with hormone therapy and small-molecule target therapy within 2 weeks; palliative radiation treatment for non-target lesions within 2 weeks; treatment with non-specific immunomodulatory therapy within 2 weeks prior to the first administration.\n3. Subjects with active central nervous system (CNS) metastases (Subjects with stable treated central nervous system \\[CNS\\] lesions who are off corticosteroid therapy for at least 2 weeks are not considered active).\n4. Subjects who have received previous treatment with \\> 1 PD-1 or PD-L1 inhibitors, such as pembrolizumab, nivolumab, atezolizumab or durvalumab.\n5. Subjects who have received previous treatment with anti-CD47 monoclonal antibody fusion protein.\n6. Subjects diagnosed with other malignancies within 2 years before the first dose with exceptions: a. cervical carcinoma in situ or basal or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin underwent radical resection; b. second primary carcinoma underwent radical resection and without recurrence within 5 years; c. double primary cancers that can benefit from this study in the opinion of the investigator.\n7. Subjects who received prior allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant or other organ transplants with acute or chromic GVHD\uff08graft versus host disease\uff09 requiring the long-term immunosuppressive therapy before 6 months of treatment.\n8. Subjects with active autoimmune diseases requiring systemic treatment (with glucocorticoids or immunosuppressive drugs) in the past 2 years with exceptions of hormone replacement therapy for thyroid disease, adrenal or pituitary insufficiency disease.\n9. Concurrent medical condition requiring systemic corticosteroids (prednisone daily dose \\> 20 mg or equivalent dose) within14 days prior to first dose of the investigational product.\n10. Subjects who underwent a major surgery within 4 weeks prior to the first dose or planned to undergo a major surgery in 3 months after receiving the investigational drug (excluding catheterization, peripherally inserted central catheter, etc.).\n11. Hypertension , pulmonary hypertension or unstable angina, which cannot be controlled by medication; treatment with myocardial infarction, bypass or stent surgery within 6 months prior to administration; a history of chronic heart failure rated by the New York Heart Association (NYHA) as grade 3-4; severe arrhythmia requiring treatment (except for atrial fibrillation or paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia that, according to the judgment of the investigators, do not affect the study); QTcF \\> 470 msec; history of cerebrovascular accident (CVA) or transient ischemic attack (TIA) within 6 months prior to enrollment;\n12. A history of arterial thrombosis, deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism within 3 months prior to the first administration.\n13. Subjects with diseases that may cause gastrointestinal bleeding or perforation;\n14. Concurrent interstitial lung disease (ILD) (except for radiation therapy-induced loco regional interstitial pneumonia), severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, severe pulmonary insufficiency.\n15. Subjects with thoracoabdominal or pericardial effusions that cannot be controlled by puncture and drainage and require repeated drainage or with significant symptoms.\n16.
