    "eligibilityCriteria": "Inclusion Criteria:\n\nThe subject must be a breast cancer survivor, at least three years beyond completion of cancer therapy, free of clinical disease, and eligible for surgical intervention.\n\n* Ages 18 to 75 years (inclusive).\n* Swelling of 1 limb that is not completely reversed by elevation or compression\n* Stage II or greater lymphedema at screening, based on the International Society of Lymphology (ISL) staging system\n* Completion of a full course of complete decongestive therapy (CDT), according to ISL guidelines at least 8 weeks prior to screening, including use of compression garments for at least 8 weeks without change in regimen\n* Willingness to maintain a stable regimen of self-care, with consistent use of compression garments from screening through the entire study duration (through the safety follow-up visit). Self-bandaging, use of nighttime compression garments, and intermittent pneumatic compression devices are allowed, but the procedures and regimens must remain consistent from screening though the entire study duration.\n* Two consecutive measurements of limb volume (LV) in the affected limb taken at least 1 day apart during the screening period must be within 10% of each other. A maximum of 3 measurements can be taken. Affected limb volume ratio \\>20% (affected limb compared to unaffected limb); volume measurements will be performed and volume ratio will be calculated at S1 and S2 visit.\n* Evidence of abnormal bioimpedance ratio, if feasible based upon unilateral disease: L-Dex \\>10 units; bioimpedance performed at S1 and S1\n* Willingness and ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent form document\n* Willingness and ability to comply with all study procedures, including measurement of skin thickness using skin calipers.\n* Participants must have NED, completed breast cancer therapy 3 years prior to enrollment.\n* ECOG 0- 2\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Edema arising from increased capillary filtration will be excluded.\n* Inability to safely undergo general anesthesia and/or perioperative care related to vascularized lymph node transfer\n* Concurrent participation in a clinical trial of any other investigational drug or therapy, regardless of indication, within 1 month before screening or 5 times the drug's half-life, whichever is longer\n* Recent initiation of (\u22648 weeks), or intention to initiate, CDPT or maintenance physiotherapy for lymphedema at any time during the duration of the study\n* Other medical condition that could lead to acute limb edema, such as (but not limited to) acute venous thrombosis\n* Other medical condition that could result in symptoms overlapping those of lymphedema in the affected limb (e.g., pain, swelling, decreased range of motion)\n* History of clotting disorder (hypercoagulable state)\n* Chronic (persistent) infection in the affected limb\n* Any other infection (unrelated to lymphedema) within 1 month prior to screening\n* Current evidence of malignancy or any high risk for breast cancer recurrence (Stage III or IV, ER/PR/HER-2 negative (triple negative) cancer , locally advanced disease, inflammatory breast cancer, \\> 3 positive axillary lymph nodes, extracapsular nodal extension, invasive micropapillary breast carcinoma, or if performed, patients with a high risk of recurrence based on multi-gene signatures, e.g. BRCA1, BRCA 2, Oncotype DX (high risk recurrence score) or Mammaprint (poor risk signature)\n* Currently receiving chemotherapy or radiation therapy\n* Life expectancy \\< 2 years for any reason\n* Pregnancy or nursing\n* Substance abuse (such as alcohol or drug abuse) within 6 months prior to screening\n* Significant or chronic renal insufficiency (defined as serum creatinine \\> 2.5 mg/dL or an estimated glomerular filtration rate \\[eGFR\\] \\< 30 mL/min at screening) or requires dialytic support\n* Hepatic dysfunction, defined as alanine transaminase (ALT) or aspartate transaminase (AST) levels \\> 3 \u00d7 upper limit of the normal range (ULN) and/or bilirubin level \\> 2 \u00d7 ULN at screening\n* Absolute neutrophil count \\< 1500 mm3 at screening\n* Hemoglobin concentration \\< 9 g/dL at screening\n* Known sensitivity to porcine products\n* Any reason (in addition to those listed above) that, in the opinion of the investigator, precludes full participation in the study",
