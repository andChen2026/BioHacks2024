No prior HER2 targeted therapy.\n  * Breast cancer: treated with prior taxane, pertuzumab, trastuzumab, and T-DXd if available and appropriate based on local standard of care and investigator's assessment. No prior HER2 targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy (antibody-drug conjugates and antibodies are allowed).\n  * Gastric cancer: treated with prior trastuzumab/platinum fluorouracil containing regimen and T-DXd. No prior HER2 targeted therapy.\n  * Other cancers: Progressed during or after \u2265 1 prior line of systemic therapy for locally advanced unresectable or metastatic disease.
