In the case of known Gilbert's syndrome \u2264 2 x ULN\n  * Serum creatinine: 1.5 x ULN\n  * Calculated creatinine clearance: \\> 50 mL/min\n* A female patient of childbearing potential may be enrolled in the study, if the patient:\n\n  * has practiced adequate contraception for 30 days prior to study product administration, and\n  * has a negative pregnancy test within one week prior to treatment allocation and\n  * has agreed to continue adequate contraception during the entire treatment period and for 2 months after completion of the study product administration series.In view of the investigator, the patient can and will comply with the requirements of the protocol.\n* Written informed consent has been obtained from the patient prior to performance of any study specific procedure.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* The patient has inflammatory breast cancer, which is defined as clinically significant erythema of the breast and/or documented dermal lymphatic invasion.\n* Diagnosis established by incisional biopsy.\n* Prior and concomitant neoadjuvant anti-breast-cancer treatments such as chemotherapy, immunotherapy / biological response modifiers, endocrine therapy, and radiotherapy, unless authorized specifically by the protocol.\n* The patient is known to be human immunodeficiency virus -positive.\n* The patient has symptomatic autoimmune disease such as, but not limited to multiple sclerosis, lupus, and inflammatory bowel disease. Patients with vitiligo are not excluded.\n* The patient is known to have difficult-to-control hypertension, coronary artery disease, arrhythmia requiring treatment, clinically significant valvular disease, cardiomegaly on chest X-ray, ventricular hypertrophy on electrocardiogram or previous myocardial infarction or congestive heart failure.\n* The patient has a history of allergic reactions likely to be exacerbated by any component of the investigational product used in the study.\n* The patient has other concurrent severe medical problems, unrelated to the malignancy, that would significantly limit full compliance with the study or expose the patient to unacceptable risk.\n* The patient has (or has had) previous or concomitant malignancies at other sites, except effectively treated malignancy that is considered by the investigator highly likely to have been cured.\n* The patient has psychiatric or addictive disorders that may compromise his/her ability to give informed consent or to comply with the study procedures.\n* The patient has received any investigational or non-registered product within 30 days preceding the first dose of study products or planned use during the study period.\n* The patient requires concomitant treatment with any immunosuppressive agents or with systemic corticosteroids prescribed for chronic treatment.\n* The patient has a significant disorder of coagulation or receives treatment with warfarin derivatives or heparin. Patients receiving individual doses of low molecular weight heparin outside of 24 hours prior to WT1-A10 + AS15 ASCI/placebo administration are eligible. Patients receiving prophylactic antiplatelet medications e.g. low-dose aspirin, and without a clinically-apparent bleeding tendency are eligible.",
