Periodic abstinence \\[e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, postovulation methods\\], withdrawal, spermicides only, and lactational amenorrhea method are not acceptable methods of contraception. Female and male condoms should not be used together.\n12. Male patients with partners of childbearing potential, even if surgically sterilized (i.e., status post-vasectomy) must agree to:\n\n    * Use effective barrier contraception from the time of consent through 90 days after discontinuation; or\n    * Agree to practice true abstinence, if this is the established and preferred contraception method by the patient and is defined as refraining from heterosexual intercourse during the entire period of risk associated with the study treatments. Periodic abstinence \\[e.g., calendar, symptothermal, post-ovulation methods\\], withdrawal, spermicides only, and lactational amenorrhea method are not acceptable methods of contraception. Female and male condoms should not be used together.\n    * In addition, male patients should also have their partners use contraception for the same period of time.\n13. Central nervous system (CNS) metastases must have been treated, be asymptomatic for \u226514 days, and meet the following at the time of enrollment:\n\n    * No concurrent treatment for CNS disease (e.g., surgery, radiation, corticosteroids \u2265 10 mg prednisone/day or equivalent).\n    * No concurrent or past history of leptomeningeal disease or cord compression.\n14.
