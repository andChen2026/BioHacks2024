    "eligibilityCriteria": "Screening phase:\n\nInclusion Criteria:\n\n* Women (or men) with histologically proven breast cancer\n* Metastatic relapse or progression or stage IV at diagnosis\n* No Her2 over-expression\n* Patients with metastases that can be biopsied, except bone metastases\n* Patients who are eligible for a first or a second line of chemotherapy in metastatic setting (left to the discretion of investigators), or who are currently treated with a first or second line of chemotherapy with a maximum of 2 cycles at the time of biopsy. Screening of patients currently treated with a second line chemotherapy should have a stable disease\n* For patients with ER+ disease, relapse or progression occurred during endocrine therapy, whatever the line, or less than 12 months after the end of endocrine therapy in adjuvant context\n* Age \u226518 years\n* WHO Performance Status 0/1\n* Presence of measurable target lesion according to RECIST criteria v1.1\n\nExclusion criteria:\n\n* Spinal cord compression and/or symptomatic or progressive brain metastases\n* Bone metastases when this is the only site of biopsiable disease\n* Patients with all target lesions in a previously irradiated region, except if clear progression has been observed prior to study in at least one of them\n* Patient who received more than 2 lines of chemotherapy at the time of the biopsy\n* Tumor progression observed with the current line of treatment when under 2nd line\n* Patients who already had a genomic profile (both CGH and NGS analysis) in which no SAFIR02 targetable alterations have been identified\n* Abnormal coagulation contraindicating biopsy\n* Inability to swallow\n* Major problem with intestinal absorption Any clinically important abnormalities in rhythm, conduction or morphology of resting ECG Any factors increasing the risk of QTc prolongation or arrhythmic events Experience of any of the following in the preceding 12 months: coronary artery bypass graft, angioplasty, vascular stent, myocardial infarction, past or current uncontrolled angina pectoris, congestive heart failure NYHA Grade \u22652, torsades de

used in the SAFIR02 trial (patients who received this previous targeted agent without the target prescreening are eligible but may not be eligible for randomisation in substudy 1 if the treatment allocated by the MTB is in the same class) History of retinal degenerative disease, eye injury or corneal surgery in the previous 3 months, past history of central serous retinopathy or retinal vein occlusion, intraocular pressure \\>21 mmHg, or uncontrolled glaucoma.\n* History of hemorrhagic or thrombotic stroke, TIA or other CNS bleeds\n* Renal disease including glomerulonephritis, nephritic

1:\n\nInclusion Criteria:\n\n* Patients who received 6 to 8 cycles of chemotherapy, or having received at least 4 cycles of chemotherapy definitively stopped for toxicity reasons, and who are presenting a SD or PR at randomization\n* presenting at least one genomic alteration from the predefined list\n* Age \u226525 years for patients planned to receive AZD4547\n* 28-day wash-out period from chemo prior to randomization and grade \u22641 residual toxicities\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* More than 2 previous lines of chemotherapy for metastatic disease before randomization\n* Life expectancy \\<3 months\n* Disease progression occuring at any time during chemotherapy and before randomization or toxicity that led to the discontinuation of the last chemotherapy before 4 full cycles have been delivered\n* Less than 28 days from radiotherapy, less than 2 weeks from palliative radiation\n* Patients previously treated with a targeted agent in the same class as the agent to be given to the patient in substudy 1\n* Toxicities of grade \u22652 from any previous anti-cancer therapy\n* Altered haematopoietic or organ function\n* Mean resting corrected QT interval (QTc) \\>480

ophthalmology specialist for patients likely to be treated with AZD4547 orAZD8931 or Selumetinib\n* Patients using non-substitutable drugs, that are known to prolong QT interval or induce Torsades de Pointes, when they are supposed to be treated with vandetanib, AZD5363 or AZD8931\n\nSubstudy 2:\n\nInclusion Criteria:\n\n* Patients who received 6 to 8 cycles of chemotherapy, or having received at least 4 cycles of chemotherapy definitively stopped for toxicity reasons, and who are presenting a SD or a RP at randomization\n* Patients not eligible to substudy 1\n* wash-out period of at least 15 days for weekly (except monoclonal antibodies) or daily chemotherapies or 28 days for other chemotherapies from last chemotherapy administration prior to randomization and grade \u22641 residual

inhibitor, including MEDI4736\n* Toxicities of grade \u22652 from any previous anti-cancer therapy\n* Altered haematopoietic or organ function\n* Mean resting QT interval corrected for heart rate
