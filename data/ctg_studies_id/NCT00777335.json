(Patients are permitted to receive thyroid hormone supplements to treat underlying hypothyroidism).\n* Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction(LVEF) assessment (2-D echocardiogram or Multiple Uptake Gated Acquisition Scan(MUGA) scan) performed within 6 weeks prior to randomization, showing a LVEF value \\> 50%\n* Electrocardiogram performed within 1 week prior to randomization (details about findings on the Electrocardiogram that are not acceptable for participating in the study are reported in the Exclusion criteria section)\n* Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) must have a negative serum pregnancy test within 7 days prior to randomization and agree to appropriate method of pregnancy prevention\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Prior Histone Deacetylase(HDAC),Deacetylase(DAC), Heat Shock Protein 90 (HSP90) inhibitors or valproic acid for the treatment of cancer\n* Patients who will need valproic acid for any medical condition during the study or within 5 days prior to first panobinostat treatment\n* Patients who have received prior chemotherapy or investigational agent within the last 4 weeks prior to randomization (6 weeks for nitrosoureas and mitomycin; 2 weeks for capecitabine)\n* Patients who have received prior radiotherapy to \u2265 25% of the bone marrow within the last 4 weeks prior to randomization; local radiotherapy is allowed however all recently irradiated lesions should not be included in the measurable disease assessment\n* Patients who have received prior investigational agents within the last 4 weeks prior to randomization\n* Patients with unresolved diarrhea \u2265CTCAE (National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events) grade 1\n* Impairment of gastrointestinal (GI) function or GI disease that may significantly alter the absorption of oral panobinostat\n* History of cardiac dysfunction including any one of the following:\n* Complete left bundle branch block or necessity for a permanent cardiac pacemaker or congenital long QT syndrome or history or presence of ventricular tachyarrhythmias or clinically significant resting bradycardia (\\<50 beats per minute) or QTcF \\> 450 msec on screening electrocardiogram(ECG) or right bundle branch block and left anterior hemiblock (bifascicular block)\n* Presence of unstable atrial fibrillation (ventricular response rate \\>100 bpm).
