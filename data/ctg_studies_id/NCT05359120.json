Pathologically diagnosed patients with HER-2 expression-positive advanced breast cancer; Note: Positive HER2 expression refers to at least one tumor cell immunohistochemical staining intensity of 3+ or fluorescence in situ hybridization \\[FISH\\] in the pathological detection/recheck of the primary or metastatic lesions performed by the pathology department of the participating central hospital confirmed positive;\n2. Brain metastases are diagnosed by MRI/enhanced CT imaging, according to RECIST 1.1 criteria, with or without measurable lesions and with or without symptoms of brain metastases;\n3. Pyrotinib combined with capecitabine in the treatment of brain metastases with non-PD evaluation at the first treatment, at least \u2265 2 continuous imaging reports or assessments\n4. For previous treatment regimens, no previous use of capecitabine or progression after capecitabine discontinuation for 6 months, or progression after discontinuation of capecitabine adjuvant therapy for one year or more;\n5.
