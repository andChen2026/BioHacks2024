PIK3CA activating mutation identified by a either in a CLIA certified tumor genomic assay or ctDNA assay.\n4. Patients may be:\n\n   1. relapsed with documented evidence of progression while on (neo) adjuvant endocrine therapy or within 12 months from completion of (neo)adjuvant endocrine therapy with no treatment for metastatic disease\n   2. relapsed with documented evidence of progression more than 12 months following/completion of (neo)adjuvant endocrine therapy and then subsequently progressed with documented evidence of progression while on or after only one line of endocrine therapy for metastatic disease\n   3. newly diagnosed advanced breast cancer, then relapsed with documented evidence of progression while on or after only one line of endocrine therapy\n   4. Prior endocrine treatment must have included a CDK4/6 inhibitor\n5. ECOG performance status 0-2\n6. Patient has adequate bone marrow and organ function as defined by the following laboratory values:\n\n   1. Absolute neutrophil count \u2265 1.0 \u00d7 109/L\n   2.

Total bilirubin \\< ULN except for patients with Gilbert's syndrome who may only be included if the total bilirubin is \u2264 3.0 \u00d7 ULN or direct bilirubin \u2264 1.5 \u00d7 ULN\u2264\n7. Fasting plasma glucose (FPG) \u2264 200 and Glycosylated Hemoglobin (HbA1c) \u2264 6.5%\n8. Fasting Serum amylase \u2264 2 \u00d7 ULN\n9. Fasting Serum lipase \u2264 ULN\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n1. Patient has not recovered from all toxicities related to prior anticancer therapies to NCI CTCAE version 4.03 Grade \u22641. Exception to this criterion: patients with any grade of alopecia are allowed to enter the study.\n2. Patient with symptomatic visceral disease or any disease burden that makes the patient ineligible for endocrine therapy per the investigator's best judgment.\n3. Patients with Type I diabetes or history of diabetic ketoacidosis\n4. Patient has received prior treatment with chemotherapy in the metastatic setting, fulvestrant, any PI3K, mTOR or AKT inhibitor\n5. Patient has a known hypersensitivity to alpelisib or fulvestrant, or to any of the excipients of alpelisib or fulvestrant.\n6. Patient is concurrently using other anti-cancer therapy.\n7. Patient has had surgery within 14 days prior to starting study drug or has not recovered from major side effects of surgery.\n8. Patient has central nervous system (CNS) involvement that does not meet ALL of the following criteria:\n\n   * completed prior therapy (including radiation and/or surgery) for CNS metastases \u2265 14 days prior to the start of study and\n   * CNS tumor is clinically stable at the time of screening and\n   * patient is not receiving steroids and/or enzyme inducing anti-epileptic medications for brain metastases\n9. Patient has impairment of gastrointestinal (GI) function or GI disease that may significantly alter the absorption of the study drugs (e.g., ulcerative diseases, uncontrolled nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, malabsorption syndrome, or small bowel resection)\n10. Patient is following a ketogenic diet and unwilling to change diet.\n11. Patient has any other concurrent severe and/or uncontrolled medical condition that would, in the investigator's judgment, contraindicate patient participation in the clinical study.\n12. Patient has currently documented pneumonitis (the chest CT scan performed at baseline for the purpose of tumor assessment should be reviewed to confirm that there are no relevant pulmonary complications present).\n13. Patient is currently receiving or has received systemic corticosteroids 7 days prior to starting study drug, or who have not fully recovered from side effects of such treatment.\n\n    Note: The following uses of corticosteroids are permitted: single doses, topical applications (e.g., for rash), inhaled sprays (e.g., for obstructive airways diseases), eye drops or local injections (e.g., intra-articular).\n14.
