Or treatment of venous/venous thrombosis events occurring within the preceding 6 months, such as cerebrovascular accidents (including transient ischemic attack, cerebral hemorrhage, cerebral infarction), deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism; Long-term anticoagulant therapy with warfarin or heparin, or long-term antiplatelet therapy (aspirin \u2265300 mg/day or clopidogrel \u226575 mg/day) is required; Active heart disease, including myocardial infarction, severe/unstable angina, occurs 6 months before treatment. Left ventricular ejection fraction \\< 50% by echocardiography and poor arrhythmia control (including QTcF interval,\\> 470 ms in women); The patient has had other malignancies (except cured basal cell carcinoma of the skin and carcinoma in situ of the cervix) within the previous 3 years or at the same time. Known allergy to the study drug or any of its excipients, or severe allergic reaction to other monoclonal antibodies; Active or uncontrolled severe infection;\n\n1. Known human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection;\n2. A known history of clinically significant liver disease, including viral hepatitis \\[active HBV infection, i.e., HBV DNA positive (\\>1\u00d7104 copies\n\n   /mL or \\>2000 IU/ml) must be excluded for a known hepatitis B virus (HBV) carrier;\n3. Known hepatitis C virus infection (HCV) and HCV RNA positive (\\>1\u00d7103 copies /mL), or other hepatitis, cirrhosis\\]; Any other medical condition, clinically significant metabolic abnormality, physical abnormality or laboratory abnormality, which, in the investigator's judgment, the patient has a medical condition or condition that is reasonably suspected to be unsuitable for the use of the study drug (such as the presence of epileptic seizures requiring treatment), or which would interfere with the interpretation of the study results, or place the patient at high risk; The patients considered by the investigators to be unsuitable for inclusion in this study.",
