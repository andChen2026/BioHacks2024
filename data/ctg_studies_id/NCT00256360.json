    "enrollmentCount": 117,
    "primaryOutcomeMeasure": "To assess the feasibility of FEC and docetaxel based sequential regimens given in dose-dense fashion (FEC every 10-11 days and docetaxel every 14 days) with pegfilgrastim in patients with high-risk primary breast cancer.",
    "eligibilityCriteria": "Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Histologically proven early breast cancer requiring adjuvant chemotherapy (lymph node positive or other features of high risk according to St-Gallen criteria)\n* Margins of resection histologically free of invasive carcinoma and ductal carcinoma in situ.\n* Radiotherapy performed according to center's policy and always follows completion of adjuvant chemotherapy\n* Performance status 0 to 1 on the ECOG scale (Appendix A)\n* The determination of ER and PgR is mandatory (immunohistochemical methods required; ER and/or PgR positivity is defined as \\> 1% of positive cells). Also determination of Her2neu is mandatory, either by immunohistochemistry or by FISH\n* Age \\> 18 years and age \\<70 years (upper age limit based on the lack of safety data for this population).\n* Normal cardiac function (assessment of LVEF by MUGA scan or echocardiography above the lower limit of normal for the institution).\n* Adequate organ function (as defined by neutrophils \\> 1.5 x109/L, Platelets \\> 100 x 109/L, Hemoglobin \\> 10 g/dl, total bilirubin \\> 1 UNL, ASAT (SGOT) and ALAT (SGPT) \\> 1.5 UNL, alkaline phosphatase \\> 2.5 UNL, creatinine \\> 1.5 mg/dl (150 \u00b5mol/L)\n* Complete staging work-up within 2 months prior to registration. All patients will have bilateral mammography, chest X-ray (PA and lateral) and/or CT-scan, abdominal ultrasound and/or CT scan, bone scan. In case of positive bone scan suspicious for metastases, bone X-ray (or bone CT-scan on spinal hot spots) is mandatory to rule out the possibility of metastatic disease. Other tests may be performed as clinically indicated.\n* Negative pregnancy test (urine or serum) within 7 days prior to registration for all women of childbearing potential. Patients of childbearing potential must implement adequate non-hormonal measures to avoid pregnancy during study treatment (chemotherapy, radiotherapy and endocrine therapy). No pregnant or lactating patients are allowed.\n* Absence of any psychological, familial, sociological or geographical condition potentially hampering compliance with the study protocol and follow-up schedule; those conditions should be discussed with the patient before registration in the trial\n* Before patient registration/randomization, written informed consent must be given according to ICH/GCP, and national/local regulations.\n\nExclusion criteria:\n\n* Metastatic disease (M1) or inoperable residual axillary disease\n* Prior systemic anticancer therapy for breast cancer (chemotherapy, hormone therapy of immunotherapy)\n* Prior radiation therapy for breast cancer.\n* Pre-existing motor or sensory neurotoxicity of a severity \\> grade 2 by NCI criteria.\n* Pregnant or lactating patients\n* Other serious illness or medical condition:\n* Congestive heart failure or unstable angina pectoris, previous history of myocardial infarction within 1 year from study entry, uncontrolled hypertension or high-risk uncontrolled arrhythmias.\n* History of significant neurological or psychiatric disorders that would prohibit the understanding and giving of informed consent.\n* Active uncontrolled infection\n* Active peptic ulcer, unstable diabetes mellitus.\n* Past or current history of other neoplasm except for curatively treated basal cell skin cancer or in situ carcinoma of the cervix.\n* Chronic treatment with steroids unless initiated \\> 6 months prior to study entry and at low dose (\\< 20 mg methylprednisolone or equivalent)\n* Concurrent treatment with hormonal replacement therapy: this treatment should be stopped at least 15 days before study entry.\n* Concurrent treatment with other experimental drugs. Participation in another clinical trial with any investigational not marketed drug within 30 days prior to study entry",
