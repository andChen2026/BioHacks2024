Subjects with brain metastases may be eligible if asymptomatic, previously treated, and all brain lesions must have been controlled for at least 6 months prior to enrollment. Subjects with untreated brain lesions that are SSTR+ may be eligible after approval by the medical monitor.\n* History of hypersensitivity or allergy to pembrolizumab or any of its components, or to 225Ac, 68Ga, 64Cu, octreotate, or any of the excipients of DOTATATE imaging agents.\n* Prior or concurrent malignancy whose natural history or treatment has the potential to interfere with the study safety or efficacy assessments.\n\nOther protocol-defined criteria may apply.",
