    "eligibilityCriteria": "Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Enrollment on the treatment phase of the I-SPY 2 TRIAL\n* Completed a standard neoadjuvant chemotherapy regimen or assigned treatment on I-SPY 2 and planning definitive surgical resection. Participants who have discontinued assigned treatment on I-SPY 2, switched to standard of care, and have completed a standard neoadjuvant chemotherapy regimen are still considered eligible.\n* Pre-surgical imaging or clinical examination demonstrating residual disease in the breast. Participants with any extent of enhancement attributable to tumor on the pre-surgical MRI are eligible. No minimum extent of palpable tumor pre-surgery is required.\n* Willing to undergo bone marrow aspiration and blood specimen collection per protocol specifications\n* No clinical evidence of distant metastatic disease. Pre-chemotherapy staging scans are sufficient in the absence of any symptoms or subsequent clinical evidence suggesting distant metastases\n* Age 18 or over and are able to give informed consent\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Individuals under the age of 18\n* Individuals who cannot understand and give informed consent. We will not be assessing decisional capacity; determination of ability to give informed consent will be at the discretion of the treating physician.\n* Pregnancy. Participants in the parent I-SPY 2 TRIAL are screened for pregnancy at enrollment and pregnancy is an exclusion criteria. No additional screening for pregnancy is required for participants enrolling on SURMOUNT. However if a study participant does become pregnant while on study or during the course of the 10 year follow-up, the study participant will remain on the study protocol and will not be withdrawn. Because this is an observational study and does not have a therapeutic component, there will be no increased risk to following a study participant through annual blood draws and medical information abstraction from the medical chart who may or may not become pregnant during the course of the follow-up period.",
