    "eligibilityCriteria": "Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Willing and able to provide written informed consent;\n* 18 years of age or older;\n* Successful completion of breast MR examination with DWI required by protocol;\n* Undiagnosed breast lesion (BI-RADS 3, 4, or 5) identified on MRI. The BI-RADS assessment must refer to a focal finding within the breast (i.e. mass, non-mass, or focus) as opposed to diffuse processes (e.g. background parenchymal enhancement, skin thickening) or lesions outside the subcutaneous breast (e.g. axillary lymph nodes, focal skin lesions, osseous lesions, etc.).\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Participants with current or recent history (within 6 months prior to the MRI) of chemotherapy for cancer;\n* Neoadjuvant chemotherapy between MRI and confirmation of lesion outcome (study lesions must be biopsied prior to undergoing any chemotherapy);\n* Pregnant (if a female is of childbearing potential - defined as a pre-menopausal female capable of becoming pregnant - confirmation of pregnancy status per the site's standard of practice should be done prior to MRI);\n* Unwilling or not suitable to undergo MRI or use the contrast agent gadolinium.",
