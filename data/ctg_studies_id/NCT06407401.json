However, women who have been amenorrhoeic for 12 or more months are still considered to be of childbearing potential if the amenorrhea is possibly due to prior chemotherapy, antioestrogens, low body weight, ovarian suppression, or other reasons.\n\n* Patients of childbearing / reproductive potential must agree to use at least one acceptable effective contraceptive measure until treatment discontinuation.\n* Female subjects who are breast feeding should discontinue nursing prior to the first dose of study treatment and until 1 month after the last study treatment.\n\nExclusion criteria:\n\n* Current history of moderate/severe depression and/or anxiety, both defined as grade\u22652 CTCAE V5.0\n* History of suicide-related events\n* Current use of diuretics, antidepressants and/or phytoestrogens\n* Current use of prescribed or natural medicines with known interactions with furosemide and/or duloxetine\n* Contraindications to duloxetine:\n\n  * Severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance \\< 30 mL/min)\n  * Uncontrolled hypertension\n  * Hepatic impairment Child Pugh Class B or C\n* Contraindications to furosemide:\n\n  * Symptomatic hypotension, hypovolemia, or dehydration\n  * Severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance \\< 30 mL/min)\n  * Severe hypokalaemia and/or severe hyponatremia\n  * Addison's disease\n  * Porphyria\n* Uncontrolled intercurrent illness, including psychiatric conditions, chronic alcoholism, and drug addiction, that would, in the judgment of the investigator, limit compliance with study requirement, substantially increase risk of incurring AEs or compromise the ability of the patient to give written informed consent.\n* Known difficulty in tolerating oral medications or conditions which would impair absorption of oral medications such as: uncontrolled nausea or vomiting (i.e., CTCAE \u2265 Grade 3 despite antiemetic therapy), ongoing gastrointestinal obstruction/motility disorder, malabsorption syndrome, or prior gastric bypass\n* Any psychological, familial, sociological or geographical condition potentially hampering compliance with the study protocol, understanding and completion of questionnaires and follow-up schedule; those conditions should be assessed and discussed with the patient before the enrolment in the trial.\n* Participation in another interventional study with drugs.",
