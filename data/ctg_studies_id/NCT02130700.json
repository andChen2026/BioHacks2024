There must be radiographic evidence of disease after primary treatment with surgery or radiotherapy that has continued to progress radiographically or biochemically (rising PSA levels on successive measurements) despite adequate androgen-deprivation therapy, which is defined as having undergone bilateral surgical castration or continued treatment on GnRH agonists or antagonists.\n* All patients in this trial must have been treated with enzalutamide.\n* Patients in Cohort 1 will not be allowed to have received prior chemotherapy; patients in Cohort 2 must have received one (and not more) prior course of chemotherapy for mCRPC.\n* Progression must be evidenced and documented by any of the following parameters:\n\n  * PSA progression defined by a minimum of two rising PSA levels with an interval of \u2265 1 week between each determination\n  * Appearance of one or more new lesions on bone scan\n  * Progressive measurable disease by RECIST 1.1",
