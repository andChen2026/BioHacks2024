Subjects with resolving hemorrhage changes, punctate hemorrhage, or hemosiderin are eligible.\n* The subject is unable to undergo MRI scan (eg, has pacemaker).\n* The subject has received enzyme-inducing anti-epileptic agents within 14 days of study drug (eg, carbamazepine, phenytoin, phenobarbital, primidone).\n* Patients whose only lesion undergoing resection has received stereotactic radiation within the past 3 months\n* The subject has received any of the following prior anticancer therapy:\n\n  * Biologic agents (antibodies, immune modulators, vaccines, cytokines) within 21 days prior to first dose of study drug\n  * Prior treatment with Sacituzumab Govitecan\n* Patients receiving UGT1A1 (Uridine diphosphate glucuronosyl transferase 1A1) inhibitors or inducers.\n* History of significant cardiovascular disease, defined as:\n\n  * Congestive heart failure greater than New York Heart Association (NYHA) Class II according to the NYHA Functional Classification.\n  * Unstable angina or myocardial infarction within 6 months before enrollment.\n  * Serious cardiac arrhythmia.\n* Clinically significant ECG abnormality, including:\n\n  * Marked Baseline prolonged QT/QTc interval (ie, a repeated demonstration of a QTc interval \\>500 ms) demonstrated on ECG at Screening.\n  * History of risk factors for torsade de pointes (eg, heart failure, hypokalemia, family history of long QT Syndrome).\n* Any medical or other condition which, in the opinion of the Investigator, causes the subject to be medically unfit to receive Sacituzumab Govitecan, or unsuitable for any other reason.",
