Patients with radiological evidence (as per RECIST v.1.1) of disease progression on the immediate prior line of treatment containing a non-steroidal aromatase inhibitor (NSAI) (anastrozole-letrozole). Patients must meet at least one of the following conditions:\n\n   1. On adjuvant endocrine therapy for \u2265 24 months and relapsing within 12 months after CDK4/6 inhibitor treatment completion following the adjuvant setting.\n   2.
