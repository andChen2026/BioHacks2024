Prior endocrine therapy in the metastatic setting is not allowed;\n4. Prior treatment with any CDK 4/6 inhibitor in the adjuvant or metastatic setting (neoadjuvant/preoperative treatment is allowed); however, prior therapy with another targeted treatment in the adjuvant setting is allowed;\n5. Visceral crisis: Advanced, symptomatic, visceral spread that is at risk of life-threatening complication in the short term and that requires chemotherapy;\n6. Any major surgery (defined as requiring general anaesthesia) or significant traumatic injury within 4 weeks of treatment initiation or patients that may require major surgery during the course of the study; however, surgical diagnostic procedure is allowed (even if performed under general anaesthesia);\n7. Known, active bleeding diathesis;\n8. Any serious known concomitant systemic disorder (e.g. known active infection including HIV, or cardiac disease) incompatible with the study (at the discretion of investigator), previous history of bleeding diathesis, or anti-coagulation treatment (the use of low molecular weight heparin is allowed);\n9.
