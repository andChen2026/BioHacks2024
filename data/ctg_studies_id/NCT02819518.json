Exceptions include basal cell carcinoma of the skin, squamous cell carcinoma of the skin that has undergone potentially curative therapy, and in situ cervical cancer.\n* Has known active central nervous system (CNS) metastases and/or carcinomatous meningitis. Participants with previously treated brain metastases may participate provided they have stable brain metastases and did not receive chemotherapy for metastatic breast cancer.\n* Has history of (non-infectious) pneumonitis that required steroids or current pneumonitis.\n* Has active, or a history of, interstitial lung disease.\n* Has a known history of active tuberculosis (TB).\n* Has an active infection requiring systemic therapy.\n* Has a history of Class II-IV congestive heart failure or myocardial infarction within 6 months of randomization.\n* Has a known psychiatric or substance abuse disorders that would interfere with cooperation with the requirements of the study.\n* Is pregnant or breastfeeding, or expecting to conceive or father children within the projected duration of the study, starting with the screening visit through 120 days (or longer as specified by local institutional guidelines) after the last dose of study drug.\n* Has received prior therapy with an anti-programmed cell death 1 (anti-PD-1), anti-PD-L1, or anti-PD-L2 agent or with an agent directed to another co-inhibitory T cell receptor (such as cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 \\[CTLA-4\\], OX-40, CD137) or has previously participated in Merck pembrolizumab (MK-3475) clinical studies.\n* Has a known history of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).\n* Has known active hepatitis B or hepatitis C.\n* Has received a live vaccine within 30 days prior to randomization.\n* Has a known history of hypersensitivity or allergy to pembrolizumab and any of its components and/or to any of the study chemotherapies (e.g., nab-paclitaxel, paclitaxel, gemcitabine, or carboplatin) and any of their components.\n* Is receiving any medication prohibited in combination with study chemotherapies as described in the respective product labels, unless medication was stopped within 7 days prior to randomization.",
