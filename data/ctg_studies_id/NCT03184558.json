Note: If patient is receiving anticoagulant therapy, then PT or PTT must be within therapeutic range of intended use of anticoagulants;\n    * Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) \u22642.5 times the ULN.\n11. Female patients of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test (either urine or serum pregnancy test) within 72 hours prior to the first dose of study treatment. If the urine test is positive or cannot be confirmed as negative, a serum pregnancy test will be required.\n12. Have resolution of toxic effect(s) of the most recent prior chemotherapy to Grade 1 or less (except alopecia). If the patient received major surgery or radiation therapy of \\>30 Gy, they must have recovered from the toxicity and/or complications from the intervention.\n13. Patients of reproductive potential must be willing to practice highly effective methods of contraception throughout the study and for 120 days after the last dose of study medication. Abstinence is acceptable if this is the usual lifestyle of the patient.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n1. Has disease that is suitable for local therapy administered with curative intent.\n2. More than 3 previous lines of therapy in the metastatic setting.\n3. Has received prior therapy with an immunomodulatory agent.\n4.
