As in OligoCare, ALL active cancer lesions (loco-regional primary and all oligometastases) were or will be treated with radical intent (surgery or radiotherapy).\n* All lesions that will be treated with radical radiotherapy have to be amenable to single-fraction SBRT. Concurrent systemic treatment is allowed.\n* Written informed consent must be given according to ICH/GCP, and national/local regulations. Patients will be consented in a step-wise approach.\n\nStep 1 \\[both control and experimental arms\\]: patients will need to consent to be included and evaluated in E\u00b2-RADIatE (that includes the non-interventional OligoCare prospective registry cohort) and to potentially be randomized to future sub-studies for which they are eligible; no further consent will be sought if they are randomized to the SoC (control) arm; Step 2 \\[experimental arm only\\]: if eligible for the current sub-study and randomized to receive single-fraction SBRT, patients will need to consent to receiving the experimental treatment.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\nAll targeted lesion judged by the treating physician to be associated with risks for severe toxicity following single-fraction SBRT. The following lesions are systematically excluded:\n\n* Pulmonary metastases within 1 cm of proximal bronchial tree, esophagus or brachial plexus\n* Metastases within \\< 5 mm of any hollow GI structure: esophagus, stomach, small bowel, large bowel\n* Metastases within \\< 5 mm of the spinal cord, the cauda equina or the brachial plexus\n* Metastases \\> 5 cm in largest diameter.",
