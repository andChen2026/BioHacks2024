Testing results for all three markers conducted within 24 months prior to the initiation of the study by a local facility accredited by clinical research center are acceptable.

A measurable lesion located at the previously irradiated radiation field or other local treatment area should not be selected as targeted lesion, unless the lesion shows unequivocal radiographic progression).\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Previous treatment with immune checkpoint agonists (such as CD137 agonists) or immune checkpoint inhibitors (such as CTLA-4, PD-1, PD-L1, LAG3 monoclonal antibody, etc.) or anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) target drugs;\n* Has uncontrolled or symptomatic brain or spine cord metastases;\n* Those who have had other active malignant tumors within 5 years prior to the study treatment, except for those that can be treated locally and have been cured ;\n* Poorly controlled hypertension (systolic blood pressure \u2265 140 mmHg and/or diastolic blood pressure \u2265 90 mmHg);\n* With a history of hypertensive crisis or hypertensive encephalopathy;\n* With a history of abdominal fistula, tracheoesophageal fistula, gastrointestinal perforation, or intra-abdominal abscess within the last 6 months prior to the start of the study treatment;\n* Adverse events resulting from prior anti-tumor therapies should be assessed and graded according to the CTCAE 5.0 criteria, subjects whose AEs have not returned to Grade 1 or below;\n* Has uncontrollable pleural, pericardial, or abdominal effusions;\n* Has received allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation or organ transplantation.",
