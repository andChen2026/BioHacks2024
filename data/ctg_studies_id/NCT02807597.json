    "eligibilityCriteria": "Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Newly diagnosed Stage I-II breast cancer patients undergoing breast-conserving therapy and SLN biopsy.\n* Negative nodal basin clinical exam.\n* At least 18 years of age.\n* Able to understand and willing to sign a written informed consent document.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Contraindications for surgery.\n* Receiving any investigational agents.\n* History of allergic reactions attributed to ICG or other agents used in the study, include known iodide or seafood allergy. The investigators do not expect many of these adverse reactions with LS301 because it is not radioactive and does not possess iodinated counter ions.\n* Presence of underlying lung disease\n* Pregnant. Female patients of childbearing potential must have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test no more than 7 days before start of participation.\n* Breastfeeding. Patients who are breastfeeding are excluded from this study because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with LS301.",
