In the case of known Gilbert's syndrome, a higher serum total bilirubin (\\< 2 \u00d7 ULN) is allowed.\n  * AST and ALT \u2264 2.5 \u00d7 ULN; if the patient has liver metastases, ALT and AST must be \u2264 5 \u00d7 ULN.\n* Renal status:\n\n  * Creatinine \u2264 1.5 \u00d7ULN or creatinine clearance \\> 60 ml/min\n  * Proteinuria \\<1 g/day\n* International Normalized Ratio (INR) or Prothrombin Time (PT) \u22641.5 \u00d7 ULN unless patient is receiving anticoagulant therapy as long as PT or PTT (partial thromboplastin time) is within therapeutic range of intended use of anticoagulant.\n\nInclusion criteria for enrollment:\n\nAll inclusion criteria for screening, plus:\n\n* Central lab confirmation on a metastatic biopsy (or biopsy from unresectable loco-regional disease) of:\n\n  * HER2-positivity (immunohistochemistry score 3+) or ERBB2- amplification (Ratio ERBB2/centromeres \u22652.0 or mean gene copy number \u2265 6),\n  * Presence of PD-L1 expression assessed by IHC (during the phase II portion of the trial a parallel, secondary cohort of 15 patients with PD-L1 negative disease will be enrolled)\n* Patient agrees to submit tumor tissue for translational research:\n\n  * tissue biopsy from unresectable loco-regional or metastatic disease obtained \u22641 year prior to enrollment or new tissue material from a recently obtained surgical or diagnostic biopsy. For patients who have presented with stage 4 disease de novo, a biopsy taken from the presumed primary breast lesion is acceptable (provided this was taken \u22641 year prior to enrollment).\n  * if available: FFPE tumor block from primary surgery or diagnostic biopsy.\n  * if available: pre-treatment fresh frozen tumor biopsy.\n  * if feasible: FFPE tumor block from post-treatment biopsy will be taken at time of disease progression or end of all treatment if ended prior to progression. This re-biopsy is strongly advised.\n  * if feasible: fresh frozen tumor biopsy from post-treatment biopsy will be taken at time of disease progression or end of all treatment if ended prior to progression.\n* Patient agrees to submit baseline (pre-treatment) blood and serial plasma for translational research\n* For patient of childbearing potential, negative serum pregnancy test. Pregnancy test has to be repeated within 72h before treatment start.\n* All anti-cancer treatment including endocrine therapy, with the exception of trastuzumab, must stop 3 weeks prior to first dose of trial treatment.\n\nExclusion criteria for screening:\n\n* Prior therapy with other anti-PD-1, anti- PD-L1, L2 or anti-CTLA4 therapy.\n* No FFPE material to centrally assess HER2-positivity and PD-L1 expression.\n* Known Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) (HIV 1/2 antibodies), or positive for Hepatitis B (HBsAg reactive) or Hepatitis C (HCV RNA \\[qualitative\\]).\n* Interstitial lung disease\n* History of or active pneumonitis requiring treatment with steroids\n* Active central nervous system metastases, as indicated by clinical symptoms, cerebral edema, and/or progressive growth (patients with history of CNS metastases or spinal cord compression are eligible if they are clinically and radiologically stable for at least 4 weeks before first dose of investigational product and have not required high-dose steroid treatment in the last 4 weeks).\n* Leptomeningeal disease\n* History of clinically significant or uncontrolled cardiac disease, including congestive heart failure (New York Heart Association functional classification \u22653), angina, myocardial infarction or ventricular arrhythmia.\n* Previous severe hypersensitivity reaction to treatment with another monoclonal antibody.\n* Active infection requiring systemic therapy.\n* Chronic systemic therapy with immunosuppressive agents including cortico\u00acsteroids.\n* Concurrent disease or condition that would make the patient inappropriate for trial participation or any serious medical disorder that would interfere with the patient's safety.\n* Known history of uncontrolled hypertension (\u2265 180/110), unstable diabetes mellitus, dyspnea at rest, or chronic therapy with oxygen.\n* Dementia, altered mental status, or any psychiatric condition that would prevent the understanding or rendering of Informed Consent.\n* Treatment with an investigational agent in the 4 weeks before enrollment.\n* Active autoimmune disease or a documented history of autoimmune disease, or a syndrome that requires systemic steroids or immunosuppressive agents. Patients with vitiligo or resolved childhood asthma/atopy would be an exception to this rule. Patients that require intermittent use of bronchodilators or local steroid injections would not be excluded from the trial. Patients with hypothyroidism stable on hormone replacement or Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome will not be excluded from the trial.\n* Chemotherapy, radioactive therapy, and/or biological cancer therapy within 3 weeks prior to the first trial dose and has not recovered to CTCAE v.4 grade 1 or better from adverse events.\n* Pregnant or lactating women; lactation has to stop before enrollment.\n* The patient of childbearing potential who is unwilling to use highly effective contraception during treatment and up to 7 months after stop of trial treatment.
