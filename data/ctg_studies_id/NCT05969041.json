Life expectancy of \\> 12 weeks.\n7. Echocardiogram (ECHO) or multiple gated acquisition scan showing an ejection fraction greater than or equal to 50%.\n8. Electrocardiogram (ECG) showing no clinically significant abnormality at Screening or showing an average QTc interval \\< 450 msec in males and \\< 470 msec in females (\\< 480 msec for participants with bundle branch block). Either Fridericia's or Bazett's formula may be used to correct the QT interval.\n9. Oxygen saturation of greater than or equal to 90% on room air measured by pulse oximetry.\n10.

Other primary malignancies, except:\n\n    1. Adequately treated basal cell or squamous cell carcinoma\n    2. In situ carcinoma of the cervix or bladder, treated curatively and without evidence of recurrence for at least 2 years prior to the study, or\n    3. A primary malignancy which has been completely resected and in complete remission for at least 2 years\n11. History of (noninfectious) pneumonitis/interstitial lung disease that required steroids or has current pneumonitis/interstitial lung disease.\n12. Prior grade \\> 3 immune-related AEs such as pneumonitis, colitis, hepatitis, nephritis; prior dermatitis and endocrinopathies are allowed provided corticosteroids are no longer required and endocrine-replacement therapy is stable and discontinued from prior therapy.\n13. Active autoimmune disease not related to prior therapy for primary malignancy that has required systemic therapy in the last 1 year.\n14. History of symptomatic congestive heart failure (New York Heart Association classes II-IV) or serious active arrhythmias or other clinically significant cardiac disease within 12 months of enrollment.\n15. Toxicity from previous anti-cancer therapy defined as toxicities (other than alopecia, or laboratory values listed above) not yet resolved to NCI CTCAE v5.0 Grade \u2264 1 or baseline. Participants with chronic Grade 2 toxicities (eg, peripheral neuropathy, laboratory values) may be eligible per the discretion of the Investigator and Medical Monitor.\n16. Has received:\n\n    1. Radiotherapy within 2 weeks of first administration of MT-302\n    2. Cytotoxic chemotherapy for treatment of the primary malignancy within 28 days or 5 half-lives, whichever is shorter, of administration of MT-302\n    3. Immune therapy for primary malignancy (eg, monoclonal antibody therapy, checkpoint inhibitors) within 28 days or 5 half-lives, whichever is shorter of first administration of MT-302\n    4. Targeted therapies for primary malignancy within 28 days or 5 half-lives, whichever is shorter, of first administration of MT-302\n    5. Anti-cancer vaccine within 12 weeks of first administration of MT-302\n    6. COVID-19 mRNA vaccine within 6 weeks of first administration of MT-302\n17. Has received a live vaccine \u2264 6 weeks prior to first administration of MT-302\n18. Has received packed red blood cells or platelet transfusion within 2 weeks prior to first administration of MT-302\n19. History of an allergic reaction to any of the excipients\n20. Enrollment in another interventional clinical trial within 28 days or 5 half-lives of the drug, whichever is shorter, of first administration of MT-302\n21.
