    "eligibilityCriteria": "Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Patients \u226518 years of age, no upper age limit.\n* Written informed consent obtained prior to any study specific procedures or assessments.\n* Histologically confirmed diagnosis of cancer:\n\n  1. Phase I: patients with advanced or metastatic solid tumors without established standard therapeutic alternatives.\n  2. Phase II: platinum-resistant ovarian cancer patients (epithelial non-mucinous), triple negative breast cancer and endometrial cancer (any grade).\n* For patients included in the phase II part of the study, evidence of measurable disease per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria version 1.1 is required.\n\n  1. At least one lesion, not previously irradiated, that can be accurately measured at baseline as \u2265 10 mm in the longest diameter (except lymph nodes which must have short axis \u2265 15 mm) with computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and which is suitable for accurate repeated measurements, OR\n  2. At least one lesion (measurable and/or non-measurable) that can be accurately assessed by (CT/MRI/plain x-ray) at baseline and follow up visits.\n* Patients included in the phase II part of the study must have received at least one line of standard therapy for locally advanced or metastatic disease, and developed progression disease afterwards.\n* ECOG score \\< 2.\n* Life expectancy of \u2265 3 months.\n* Patients must have normal organ and bone marrow function measured within 28 days prior to administration of study treatment as defined below:\n\n  1. Haemoglobin \u2265 10.0 g/dL and no blood transfusions in the 28 days prior to entry/randomisation (choose whichever is most applicable to the study).\n  2. Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) \u2265 1.5 x 109/L\n\n  i. No features suggestive of myelodisplastic syndrome (MSD)/ Acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) on peripheral blood smear c. White blood cells (WBC) \\> 3x109/L d. Platelet count \u2265 100 x 109/L e. Total bilirubin \u2264 1.5 x institutional upper limit of normal (ULN) f. AST (SGOT)/ALT (SGPT) \u2264 2.5 x institutional ULN unless liver metastases are present in which case it must be \u2264 5x ULN g. Albumin \u2265 3.0 g/dl h. Serum creatinine \u2264 1.5 x institutional ULN i. Creatinine clearance \u2265 30 ml/min.\n* Patients should sign an informed consent form before inclusion in the study that specifies that the clinical trial treatment entails consent for the analysis of biological samples of tumor and blood.\n* Patient is willing and able to comply with the protocol for the duration of the study including undergoing treatment and scheduled visits and examinations including follow up.\n* Evidence of non-childbearing status for women of childbearing potential (WOCBP)\\*.\n\nWOCBP should only be included after a confirmed menstrual period and a negative urine or serum pregnancy test within 28 days of study treatment, confirmed prior to treatment on day 1.. The inclusion of WOCBP requires use of a highly effective contraceptive measure (Appendix H).\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\nPatients should not enter the study if any of the following exclusion criteria are fulfilled:\n\n* Involvement in the planning and/or conduct of the study.\n* Previous enrolment or randomization in the present study.\n* Simultaneous participation in any other study involving an investigational medicinal product, or having participated in a study less than 28 days prior to the start of study treatment.\n* For patients included in the phase I of the study, previous treatment with olaparib or PM01183. For patients included in the phase II of the study, any previous treatment with a PARP inhibitor, including olaparib, or PM01183.\n* Patients receiving any systemic chemotherapy, radiotherapy (except for palliative reasons), within 2 weeks from the last dose prior to study treatment (or a longer period depending on the defined characteristics of the agents used). The patient can receive a stable dose of bisphosphonates for bone metastases, before and during the study as long as these were started at least 4 weeks prior to treatment with study drug.\n* Olaparib and PM01183 are metabolized mainly by CYP3A4. Therefore, concomitant use of known strong CYP3A4 inhibitors such as ketokonazole, itraconazole, telithromycin and clarithromycin are forbidden. Concomitant use of known CYP3A4 strong inducers. (See Appendix K for a list of CYP inducers, inhibitors and substrates).\n* Persistent toxicities (\u2265 CTCAE grade 2) with the exception of alopecia, caused by previous cancer therapy.\n* Resting ECG with QTc \\> 470msec on 2 or more time points within a 24 hour period or family history of long QT syndrome.\n* Patients with myelodysplastic syndrome/acute myeloid leukaemia.\n* Patients with symptomatic uncontrolled brain metastases. A scan to confirm the absence of brain metastases is not required. The patient can receive a stable dose of corticosteroids before and during the study as long as these were started at least 28 days prior to treatment.\n* Major surgery within 14 days of starting study treatment and patients must have recovered from any effects of any major surgery. Patients considered a poor medical risk due to a serious, uncontrolled medical disorder, non-malignant systemic disease or active, uncontrolled infection. Examples include, but are not limited to, uncontrolled ventricular arrhythmia, recent (within 3 months) myocardial infarction, unstable spinal cord compression (untreated and unstable for at least 28 days prior to study entry), superior vena cava syndrome, extensive bilateral lung disease on HRCT scan or any psychiatric disorder that prohibits obtaining informed consent.\n* Patients unable to swallow orally administered medication and patients with gastrointestinal disorders likely to interfere with absorption of the study medication.\n* Breast feeding women.\n* Immunocompromised patients, e.g., patients who are known to be serologically positive for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and are receiving antiviral therapy.\n* Patients with known active hepatic disease (i.e., Hepatitis B or C) due to risk of transmitting the infection through blood or other body fluids.\n* Patients who present any contraindication or suspected allergy to the products (or any of the excipients) under investigation in the study.\n* Patients with uncontrolled seizures.\n* For patients included at the phase II part of the study: patients with second primary cancer, except: adequately treated non-melanoma skin cancer, curatively treated insitu cancer of the cervix, or other solid tumours curatively treated with no evidence of disease for \u2265 5 years.",
