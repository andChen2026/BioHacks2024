    "eligibilityCriteria": "Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Histologic proof of cancer which is now not amenable to curative standard treatment options\n* Patient must have received at least 1 prior standard therapy for their disease\n* Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status (PS) 0, 1 or 2\n* Ability to provide informed written consent\n* Willing to return to enrolling institution for follow-up (active monitoring phase of the study); Note: During the active monitoring phase of a study (i.e., active treatment), participants must be willing to return to the consenting institution for follow-up\n* Life expectancy \\>= 84 days (3 months)\n* Identification of a drug target/targets through molecular profiling performed as a part of routine clinical care and treatment recommendation by the Mayo Clinic Genomics Tumor Board (GTB); NOTE: If profile matches more than 1 treatment arm, final decision for treatment arm assignment to be made by patients treating physician; it will be required for the genomic aberration to be identified through a test in a Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA) workflow; assays used will range from single gene abnormalities (e.g. fluorescent in situ hybridization \\[FISH\\] for human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 \\[ERBB2\\] amplifications) to next generation sequencing based gene panels (Foundation One\u00ae) to more comprehensive assays such as whole exome sequencing; the Mayo Clinic GTB will serve as the centralized point of data synthesis to allow for assessment of molecular profiling accomplished through a heterogeneous array of tests\n* Date of Mayo Clinic Genomics Tumor Board review =\\< 3 months prior to registration\n* Measurable disease by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version (v)1.1 criteria (for solid tumors) or equivalent criteria (for patients with non-solid tumor malignancies)\n* Patient meets all sub-protocol specific criteria of each applicable sub-protocol\n* Ability to complete questionnaire(s) by themselves or with assistance\n* SUB-PROTOCOL AIM A: Histological confirmation of renal cell carcinoma, head and neck cancer, endometrial cancer, breast cancer, ovarian cancer, prostate cancer, squamous cell cervical or uterine cancer, or bladder cancer\n* SUB-PROTOCOL AIM A: Confirmation of advanced cancer with mTOR pathway aberrations as determined through routine clinical care using pathway aberrations performed in a CLIA certified laboratory; cancer genomic profiling tests incorporating next generation sequencing from archival formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue (FFPE) are validated with sensitivities and specificities of 99% and 99%, respectively; in the assay, hybrid-capture-selected deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) libraries are sequenced to depths targeting \\> 500 \u00d7 coverage by non-polymerase chain reaction (PCR) duplicate read pairs, with \\> 99% of exons at coverage \\> 100 \u00d7); multiplatform profiling may include immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization methods with previously established negative/positive cutoffs performed in a CLIA certified lab; at least one pathway aberration must be identified; these must be confirmed in a CLIA certified lab; the potential mTOR aberrations that could be identified are listed below, please note that this list is not all inclusive; if a CLIA validated report lists an mTOR pathway inhibitor as a target drug for a genetic aberration, then it can be considered eligible for the purposes of this study;
