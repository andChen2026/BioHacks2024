Prior treatment with anthracyclines and taxanes (unless clinically contraindicated) and two or more prior lines of hormone therapy in hormone receptor positive disease.\n10. At least 3 months life expectancy.\n11. Patient of childbearing potential should have a negative urine or serum pregnancy within 72 hours prior to receiving the first dose of study drug/medication. If the urine test is positive or cannot be confirmed as negative, a serum pregnancy test will be required.\n12. Patients of childbearing potential (see section 4.4. for definition) must be willing to use an adequate method of contraception as outlined in Section 4.4. - Contraception, for the course of the study through 120 days after the last dose of study medication.\n\n    Note: Abstinence is acceptable if this is the usual lifestyle and preferred contraception for the subject.\n13. Willingness and ability to comply with scheduled visits, treatment plan, laboratory tests and other study procedures.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n1. HER2-positive disease by immunohistochemistry or in situ hybridation (FISH-SISH-CISH).\n2. Patient is currently participating or has participated in a study of an investigational agent and received study therapy or used an investigational device within 4 weeks of the first dose of study drug/medication.\n3. Has had a prior anti-cancer monoclonal antibody (mAb) within 4 weeks prior to study day 1 or who has not recovered (i.e., \u2264 grade 1 or at baseline) from adverse events due to agents administered more than 4 weeks earlier.\n4. Has had prior chemotherapy, targeted small molecule therapy, or radiation therapy within 2 weeks prior to study day 1 or who has not recovered (i.e., \u2264 grade 1 or at baseline) from adverse events due to a previously administered agent.\n\n   * Note: Patients with \u2264 grade 2 neuropathy are an exception to this criterion and may qualify for the study.\n   * Note: If patient received major surgery, they must have recovered adequately from the toxicity and/or complications from the intervention prior to starting therapy.\n5. Has received prior therapy with an anti-Programmed death-1 (PD), anti-PD-L1, or anti-PD-L2 agent.\n6. Has received a live vaccine within 30 days of planned start of study therapy.\n\n   o Note: Seasonal influenza vaccines for injection are generally inactivated flu vaccines and are allowed; however, intranasal influenza vaccines (e.g., Flu-Mist) are live attenuated vaccines, and are not allowed.\n7. Has hypersensitivity to pembrolizumab, gemcitabine or any of theirs excipients.\n8. Has known active central nervous system (CNS) metastases and/or carcinomatous meningitis. Patients with previously treated brain metastases may participate provided they are stable (without evidence of progression by imaging for at least four weeks prior to the first dose of trial treatment and all neurologic symptoms have returned to baseline), have no evidence of new or enlarging brain metastases, and are not using steroids for at least 7 days prior to trial treatment. This exception does not include carcinomatous meningitis which is excluded regardless of clinical stability.\n9.

Has an active autoimmune disease that has required systemic treatment in the past 2 years (i.e. with use of disease modifying agents, corticosteroids or immunosuppressive drugs). Replacement therapy (e.g., thyroxine, insulin, or physiologic corticosteroid replacement therapy for adrenal or pituitary insufficiency, etc.) is not considered a form of systemic treatment.\n11. Has a current or prior malignancy within the previous 5 years (other than breast cancer or adequately treated basal cell or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin or in-situ carcinoma of the cervix).\n12.

Has a known history of active Tuberculosis Bacillus (TB) or Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) (HIV 1/2 antibodies) or a known active Hepatitis B (e.g., HBsAg reactive) or Hepatitis C (e.g., hepatitis C virus (HCV) RNA \\[qualitative\\] is detected).\n15. Has a history or current evidence of any condition, therapy, or laboratory abnormality that might confound the results of the trial, interfere with the patient's participation for the full duration of the trial, or is not in the best interest of the patient to participate, in the opinion of the treating investigator.\n16. Has known psychiatric or substance abuse disorders that would interfere with cooperation with the requirements of the trial.\n17.
