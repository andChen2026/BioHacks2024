In addition, ER and/or PR positivity by institutional standard is required on pathology from the most recent tumor specimen if biopsy was done unless the tissue source (for example, pleural effusion or ascites or bone biopsy) may yield false negative ER and/or PR result, in which case the pathology from an earlier time point could be used and a discussion with the study chair is required.\n* To be eligible for the Part II fulvestrant-treated ER+ cohort, prior disease progression on fulvestrant is required. In addition, ER and/or PR positivity by institutional standard is required on pathology from the most recent tumor specimen unless the tissue source (for example, pleural effusion or ascites or bone biopsy) may yield false negative ER and/or PR result, in which case the pathology form an earlier time point could be used and a discussion with the study chair is required.\n\nInclusion Criteria for Registration (for patients with HER2 mutation identified at an outside CLIA certified location):\n\n* Histologically or cytologically confirmed HER2-negative (0 or 1+ by IHC or non-amplified by FISH) breast cancer that is stage IV.\n* Tumor tissue or circulating tumor DNA tested positive for HER2 mutation. Mutations outside the list will be assessed on a case-by-case basis by the study team to determine eligibility.\n* Presence of measurable or non-measurable disease by RECIST 1.1 is acceptable, except to be eligible for the Part II fulvestrant-na\u00efve ER+ cohort, at least one measurable disease by RECIST 1.1 is required.\n* At least 18 years of age.\n* ECOG performance status \\< 2 (see Appendix A).\n* Adequate organ function as defined below within 2 weeks of registration:\n\n  * Absolute neutrophil count: \u22651.5 \u00d7 109/L (1500/mm3)\n  * Platelet count: \u2265100 \u00d7 109/L (100,000/mm3)\n  * Serum creatinine: \u22641.5 x ULN\n  * Child-Pugh class A if with liver disease\n* The patient must have completed radiation therapy and be at least 1 week from the last systemic therapy administration, with adequate recovery of bone marrow and organ functions, before starting neratinib.\n* Presence of disease progression on the most recent disease evaluation.\n* Patients with known treated brain metastasis are eligible, but must have received radiation and be off steroids and stable (without evidence of disease progression by imaging or exam) for 3 months.\n* QTc interval \u2264 450 msec for men or \u2264 470 msec for women within 2 weeks of registration.\n* LVEF \\> institutional LLN within 4 weeks of registration.\n* Women of childbearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control, abstinence) prior to study entry and for the duration of study participation.
