Willingness to provide stool samples plus Patient-Reported Food Frequency Questionnaires for exploratory studies at study entry (baseline), 4 weeks after the start of treatment (C2D1), and at time of disease progression.

No prior systemic therapy for unresectable locally advanced or metastatic disease.\n15. Radiation therapy for metastatic disease is permitted but the patient must have fully recovered from the acute effects and at least 14 days must have elapsed between the last dose and randomization.\n\n    Note: For limited-field radiotherapy, at least 7 days must have elapsed between the last dose and randomization.\n16. Resolution of all acute toxic effects of prior anti-cancer therapy to Grade \u22641 as determined by the NCI-CTCAE v 5.0 (except for Grade \u22642 neuropathy, alopecia, or other toxicities not considered a safety risk for the patient at investigator's discretion) within at least 14 days prior to study Day 1.\n17. Adequate hematologic and organ function within 14 days before the first study treatment on Day 1 of Cycle 1, defined by the following:\n\n    1. Hematological: White blood cell count \\>3.0 \u00d7 109/L; Absolute neutrophil count \u22651.5 \u00d7 109/L (without granulocyte colony-stimulating factor support within 2 weeks prior to Cycle 1, Day 1); Platelet count \u2265100 \u00d7 109/L (without transfusion within 2 weeks prior to Cycle 1, Day 1); Hemoglobin \\>9.0 g/dL (without transfusion within 2 weeks prior to Cycle 1, Day 1).\n    2. Hepatic:\n\n    i. Serum albumin \u2265 3 g/dL; ii. Total bilirubin \u2264 1.5 \u00d7 ULN (\u22642 \u00d7 ULN in the case of Gilbert's disease); iii.

Formal contraindication to ET defined as visceral crisis and rapidly or symptomatic progressive visceral disease.\n4. Known concurrent malignancy or malignancy within 5 years of study enrollment except for carcinoma in situ of the cervix, non-melanoma skin carcinoma, or stage I uterine cancer. For other cancers considered to have a low risk of recurrence, discussion with the medical monitor is required.\n5. Known active brain metastases and/or carcinomatous meningitis. Participants with previously treated brain metastases may participate provided they are radiologically stable for \u22654 weeks by repeat imaging (note that the repeat imaging should be performed during study screening), clinically stable, and without requirement of steroid treatment for \u226514 days prior to first dose of study treatment.\n6. Known psychiatric or substance abuse disorders that would interfere with cooperation with the requirements of the study.\n7. Major surgical procedure within 14 days prior to treatment initiation or anticipation of the need for a major surgical procedure during the course of the study other than for diagnosis.\n\n   Note: Placement of central venous access catheter(s) (e.g., port or similar) is not considered a major surgical procedure and is therefore permitted.\n8. Active bleeding diathesis venous thrombo-embolism, previous history of bleeding diathesis, or chronic anti-coagulation treatment, or any indications or history of Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation (DIC) or Deep vein thrombosis (DVT).\n9. Serious and/or uncontrolled pre-existing medical condition(s) that, in the judgment of the investigator, would preclude participation in this study (for example, interstitial lung disease, severe dyspnea at rest or requiring oxygen therapy, severe renal impairment \\[e.g., estimated creatinine clearance \\<30 ml/min\\], history of major surgical resection involving the stomach or small bowel, or pre-existing Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis or a pre-existing chronic condition resulting in baseline Grade 2 or higher diarrhea).\n10.

Patients with past HBV infection or resolved HBV infection (defined as having a negative hepatitis B surface antibody \\[HBsAg\\] test and a positive hepatitis B core antibody \\[HBcAb\\] test, accompanied by a negative HBV DNA test) are eligible. Patients positive for HCV antibody are eligible only if polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is negative for HCV RNA.\n11. Active bacterial or fungal infection at the time of enrolment (requiring antibiotics or antifungal agents at time of initiating study treatment).\n12.
