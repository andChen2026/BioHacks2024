    "eligibilityCriteria": "Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Patients must have histologically confirmed adenocarcinoma of the breast associated with the following clinical stage: IIA, IIB, IIIA, IIIB, or IIIC; patients with stage IV disease are also eligible if there is an intention to perform breast surgery after neoadjuvant therapy is completed, or in patients participating in clinical trials where surgery after neoadjuvant therapy may be an option (eg. E2108)\n* Estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), and HER2/neu status documented by core needle biopsy of the primary tumor and/or regional lymph node must be known prior to beginning systemic therapy\n* Patients must have had a bilateral diagnostic mammogram within 6 months of registration, and may also have a targeted sonography of the breast and/or ipsilateral axilla and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) if clinically indicated\n* Patients with clinically suspicious axillary lymph node involvement must have either aspiration cytology or biopsy prior to beginning therapy\n* It is strongly encouraged that all patients have metallic clips placed in the tumor prior to neoadjuvant therapy in order to facilitate evaluation for microscopic disease at the time of surgery; placement of clips is particularly encouraged for patients being considered for breast conserving surgery\n* No prior chemotherapy, irradiation, or definitive therapeutic surgery (eg, mastectomy or lumpectomy or axillary dissection) for this malignancy; patients who have had a prior sentinel lymph node biopsy for this malignancy are eligible\n* Patients who received tamoxifen or another selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM) for prevention or for other indications (e.g., osteoporosis, prior ductal carcinoma in situ \\[DCIS\\]) are eligible; tamoxifen therapy or other SERMs should be discontinued at least 1 week before the patient is enrolled on this study\n* The patient is medically suitable candidate for preoperative chemotherapy and surgery in the judgment of the treating physicians\n* Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document, and willing to provide blood samples before and during preoperative therapy; patients are also asked but not required to have research biopsies performed before and after therapy",
