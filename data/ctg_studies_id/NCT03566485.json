Post-menopausal status in females under 55 years of age should be confirmed with a serum follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) level within laboratory reference range for postmenopausal women.\n\n* Patients unable to read/write in English are eligible to participate in the overall study but will not participate in the Patient-Reported Outcome questionnaires throughout the trial\n* Re-enrollment of a subject that has discontinued the study as a pre-treatment screen failure (i.e. a consented patient who did not receive study drugs) is permitted. If re-enrolled, the subject must be re-consented. Only the screening procedures performed outside of protocol-specified timing must be repeated.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Prior therapy with anti-PD-L1 and anti-PD1 antibodies, MEK inhibitors or MDM2 antagonists.\n* No more than 3 lines of chemotherapy in the metastatic setting\n* No concurrent anticancer therapy.
