    "eligibilityCriteria": "Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* The treating surgeon must determine that breast conservation therapy (BCT) would be made more feasible by reducing tumor size using neoadjuvant systemic therapy\n* The patient must have signed and dated an institutional review board (IRB) approved consent form that conforms to federal and institutional guidelines\n* The patient must be female\n* The patient must be greater than or equal to 18 years old\n* The patient must have an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Score (ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1\n* The diagnosis of invasive carcinoma of the breast must have been made by core needle biopsy\n* The primary breast tumor must be \\>= 2 cm by physical exam or imaging\n* Ipsilateral axillary lymph nodes must be evaluated by imaging (MRI or ultrasound) within 6 weeks prior to randomization; If indicated for abnormal lymph nodes, fine needle aspirate (FNA) or core biopsy must be performed.\n* The tumor must have been determined to be HER2-negative as follows:\n\n  * Fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH)-negative (defined by ratio of HER2 to Chromosome 17 centromere (CEP17) must be \\< 2.2) or, if a ratio was not performed, the HER2 gene copy number must be \\< 4 per nucleus; or\n  * Chromogenic in situ hybridization (CISH) is performed, the result must indicate a HER2 gene copy number of \\< 6 per nucleus; or\n  * Immunohistochemistry (IHC) 0-1+; or\n  * IHC 2+ and FISH-negative or CISH-negative\n* The tumor must have been determined to be ER+ and/or progesterone positive (PgR+) defined as \\> 10% tumor staining by immunohistochemistry\n* The patient must have been evaluated by a treating physician, reviewed and discussed by the multi-disciplinary breast team, and considered to be a candidate for chemotherapy\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* FNA alone to diagnose the primary tumor\n* Excisional biopsy or lumpectomy performed prior to randomization\n* Surgical axillary staging procedure or sentinel node (SN) biopsy performed prior to registration\n* Tumors clinically staged as including inflammatory breast cancer\n* Ipsilateral cN2b or cN3 disease (patients with cN1 or cN2a disease are eligible)\n* Definitive clinical or radiologic evidence of metastatic disease (Note: chest imaging \\[mandatory for all patients\\] and other imaging \\[if required\\] must have been performed within 6 weeks prior to randomization)\n* Synchronous or metachronous contralateral invasive breast cancer; (patients with synchronous and/or metachronous contralateral ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) or lobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS) are eligible)\n* HER2 test result of IHC 3+, regardless of FISH results, if performed\n* Any history of ipsilateral invasive breast cancer or ipsilateral DCIS if treated with radiation therapy (RT); (patients with synchronous or metachronous ipsilateral LCIS are eligible)\n* History of non-breast malignancies, except for in situ cancers treated only by local excision and basal cell and squamous cell carcinomas of the skin, within 5 years prior to randomization\n* Treatment including RT, chemotherapy, and/or targeted therapy for the currently diagnosed breast cancer prior to registration\n* Cardiac disease (history of and/or active disease) that would preclude the use of chemotherapy\n* Pregnancy or lactation at the time of randomization; (Note: pregnancy testing must be performed within 2 weeks prior to randomization for women of childbearing potential)\n* Other non-malignant systemic disease that would preclude the patient from receiving study treatment or would prevent required follow-up\n* Psychiatric or addictive disorders or other conditions that, in the opinion of the investigator, would preclude the patient from meeting the study requirements\n* Use of any investigational product within 30 days prior to registration",
