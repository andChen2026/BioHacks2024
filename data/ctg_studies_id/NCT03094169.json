Any antineoplastic agent for the primary malignancy (standard or investigational), without delayed toxicity, within 4 weeks, 5 plasma half-lives, or twice the duration of the biological effect, whichever is shortest, prior to first study drug administration and during study with the exception of: Nitrosoureas and nitrogen mustard within 6 weeks prior to first study drug administration and during study\n2. Any other investigational treatments during study. This includes participation in any medical device or other therapeutic intervention clinical trials.\n3. Radiotherapy for target lesions within 4 weeks prior to first study drug administration and during study\n4. Herbal preparations or related over-the-counter (OTC) preparations/supplements containing herbal ingredients aimed at treating the underlying malignancy within 2 weeks prior to first study drug administration and during study\n5. Strong inhibitors and/or inducers of cytochrome P450 (CYP) isoenzyme 3A4 within 2 weeks prior to first study drug administration and during study\n6. Immunosuppressive or systemic hormonal therapy within 2 weeks prior to first study drug administration and during study.\n7.
