    "eligibilityCriteria": "Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Patients must have histologically-confirmed operable invasive breast cancer and have undergone core needle biopsy with an anticipated surgical resection for residual disease after enrollment\n* Patients must have clinical stage I-III invasive breast (invasive tumor must be clinically at least \\>= T1c by radiograph or palpation)\n* Patients must have available tissue from core biopsies for biomarker assessment; it is recommended that at least 4 cores be performed with 12 gauge (or smaller gauge) needles; this includes cores underneath ultrasound-guidance\n* Patients are planning to undergo surgical treatment with either segmental resection or total mastectomy (required: 2 doses of weekly MK-2206 prior to surgery; the first dose will be at day -9 \\[+/- 1 day\\] and second dose at day -2 \\[+/- 1 day\\] in relation to surgery \\[day 0\\])\n* Patients may have a history of contralateral breast cancer, provided there is no evidence of recurrence of the initial primary breast cancer\n* Patients must have an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0-1 (Karnofsky \\>= 80%)\n* Leukocytes \\>= 3,000/ul within 28 days of registration\n* Platelets \\>= 100,000 /uL within 28 days of registration\n* Hemoglobin (Hgb) \\>= 9 g/dL within 28 days of registration\n* Creatinine =\\< 1.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN) within 28 days of registration\n* Prothrombin time (PT), partial thromboplastin time (PTT) =\\< 1.2 x ULN within 28 days of registration\n* Total bilirubin =\\< 1.5 x ULN within 28 days of registration\n* Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) \\< 2.5 x ULN within 28 days of registration\n* Patients of childbearing potential must have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test beta-human chorionic gonadotropin (\u03b2-hCG) within 72 hours prior to receiving the first dose of study medication\n* Women of childbearing potential and men must use two forms of contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry and for the duration of study participation; should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while she or her partner is participating in this study, the patient should inform the treating physician immediately\n* Patient must be able to swallow oral tablets\n* Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document\n* Patients must agree to biomarker assessment of pre-treatment diagnostic core biopsy tissue and the surgical resection tissue (i.e. excision or mastectomy); also, must agree to pre- and post-treatment fasting blood biomarker collection\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Patients may not have any known evidence of distant metastatic disease (i.e., lung, liver, bone, or brain metastases) or locally recurrent breast cancer\n* Patients with inflammatory breast cancer are not eligible\n* Patients with prior chemotherapy or radiation therapy within 6 months of study entry are not eligible (i.e. patient who have received neoadjuvant therapy are not eligible)\n* Patients may not be receiving any other investigational agents, including other inhibitors of PI3K, Akt, or mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR)\n* Men diagnosed with breast cancer\n* Patients may not have a history of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic composition to MK-2206 used in the study\n* Patients with known diabetes which is poorly controlled diabetes (hemoglobin A1c \\[HBA1C\\] \\>= 8%) should be excluded; if patient is taking metformin, must have been taking this medication for \\> 3 months, as metformin is thought to impact PI3K/Akt signaling\n* Baseline corrected QT interval (QTc) \\> 470 msec will exclude patients from entry on study; patients with a baseline bundle branch block will be excluded\n* Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements\n* Pregnant women are excluded from this study; breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated with MK2206\n* Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive patients on combination antiretroviral therapy are ineligible",
