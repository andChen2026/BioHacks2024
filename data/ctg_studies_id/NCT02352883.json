    "eligibilityCriteria": "Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Registration to Step 1:\n* Patients must have pathologically confirmed diagnosis of unilateral ductal carcinoma in situ with no evidence of microinvasive or invasive disease obtained by core needle biopsy within 4 months of registration; patients diagnosed by surgical excision are not eligible; patients with synchronous bilateral disease are not eligible; patients with synchronous bilateral disease (i.e., synchronous DCIS or invasive cancer) are not eligible\n\n  * Patients will be staged prior to registration according to the clinical staging criteria adapted from the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) Cancer Staging Data Forms of the AJCC Cancer Staging Manual, 7th Edition, 2009; Note: For consistency purposes, AJCC 7th Edition will continue to be used throughout the entire study enrollment period\n* Required studies include a bilateral screening mammogram within 6 months and diagnostic mammogram of the affected breast within 3 months prior to registration\n* Patients must not have previous ipsilateral invasive breast cancer or DCIS\n* Patients must not have known deleterious mutations in breast cancer (BRCA) genes\n* Patients must not have received hormonal therapy (i.e., tamoxifen, raloxifene, and/or aromatase inhibitors) for prevention of breast cancer within 3 months of the biopsy documenting DCIS\n* Patients must not have history of chemotherapy for cancer within 6 months prior to registration\n* No prior history of breast radiotherapy that will prevent the use of radiotherapy for the present DCIS\n* Patients must be judged to be suitable to undergo MRI and receive the contrast agent gadolinium (exclusions follow):\n\n  * No history of untreatable claustrophobia;\n  * No presence of metallic objects or implanted medical devices in body (i.e., cardiac pacemaker, aneurysm clips, surgical clips, prostheses, artificial hearts, valves with steel parts, metal fragments, shrapnel, tattoos near the eye, or steel implants);\n  * No history of sickle cell disease;\n  * No contraindication to intravenous contrast administration;\n  * No known allergy-like reaction to gadolinium or moderate or severe allergic reactions to one or more allergens as defined by the American College of Radiology (ACR); patient may be eligible if willing to undergo pre-treatment as defined by the institution's policy and/or ACR guidance;\n  * No findings consistent with renal failure, as determined by glomerular filtration rate (GFR) \\< 30 mL/min/1.73 m\\^2 based on a serum creatinine level obtained within 28 days prior to registration;\n  * Weight lower than that allowable by the MRI table;\n* No prior MRI of the breasts within the 6 months prior to registration\n* Patients must be eligible for breast-conserving therapy (BCT) based on clinical examination and mammography; if ultrasound is performed, findings must also be consistent with eligibility for BCT\n* Patients must not have multicentric disease scheduled to undergo multiple lumpectomies; multifocal disease that can be encompassed in a single operative bed are eligible\n* Women must not be pregnant or breast-feeding; all females of childbearing potential must have a blood test or urine study within 3 weeks prior to registration to rule out pregnancy; a female of childbearing potential is any woman, regardless of sexual orientation or whether they have undergone tubal ligation, who meets the following criteria:\n\n  * Has not undergone a hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy; or\n  * Has not been naturally postmenopausal for at least 24 consecutive months (i.e., has had menses at any time in the preceding 24 consecutive months)\n* Women of childbearing potential must be strongly advised to use an accepted and effective method of contraception or to abstain from sexual intercourse for the duration of their participation in the study\n* Registration to Step 2:\n* MRI has been performed in Step 1, and additional imaging studies and biopsies performed if indicated\n* The clinician/patient has made the decision as to whether the patient will proceed to wide local excision or mastectomy\n* Registration to Step 3:\n* Patient's most recent surgery was wide local excision with or without re-excision and for which there was obtained clear (\\>= 2 mm) margins at breast conserving surgery, and the pathology reveals pure DCIS; patients with invasive cancer or DCIS with microinvasion will not be registered on step 3, but will be followed for clinical outcomes\n* The OncotypeDX Patient Report of the DCIS Score from the OncotypeDX Breast Cancer Assay performed by Genomic Health on the excision tissue have been uploaded by the site into the Rave electronic case report forms (eCRF)",
