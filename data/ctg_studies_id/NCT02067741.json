Note: TNBC patients with only locally assessed ARpos (\\>0%) status are not allowed to enter the trial in Phase II.\n\n  * Stratum A: Patients had 1 line of prior endocrine treatment for advanced disease with a treatment duration of \u22656 months and no evidence of progression at 6 months. No previous chemotherapy for advanced disease is allowed.\n  * Stratum B: TN-ARpos BC patients had \u22642 lines of prior chemotherapy treatment for advanced disease.\n* Patient is suitable for endocrine treatment.\n* Presence of \u22651 measurable or evaluable lesion according to RECIST 1.1.\n* Tumor assessment to be performed within 28 days before or on registration.\n* Baseline PRO questionnaire (FACT-ES) has been completed (Phase II only).\n* WHO performance status 0-1.\n* Age \u2265 18 years.\n* Adequate hematological values: hemoglobin \u2265100 g/L, ANC \u22651.5x109/L, platelets \u2265100x109/L.\n* Adequate hepatic function: total bilirubin \u22641.5xULN, ALT \u22642.5xULN (except for liver metastases \u22645xULN).\n* Adequate renal function: serum creatinine \u22641.5xULN.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Previous malignancy within 5 years with the exception of adequately treated cervical carcinoma in situ or localized non-melanoma skin cancer.\n* Uncontrolled central nervous system (CNS) metastases, pulmonary carcinomatous lymphangiosis (i.e., \\>50% invasion), or liver metastases on \\>1/3 of the liver on ultrasound or computed tomography (CT).\n* Unsuitable for endocrine therapy (e.g. due to rapidly progressing disease or impending 6.2.3complication).\n* Indication for chemotherapy.\n* Psychiatric disorder precluding understanding of information on trial related topics, giving informed consent, filling out PRO forms, or interfering with compliance for oral drug intake.\n* Concurrent treatment with other experimental drugs in a clinical trial within 30 days prior to trial treatment start or other anti-cancer therapy within 14 days. Treatment with bisphosphonates/denosumab is allowed. Bisphosphonates/denosumab treatment had to be started at least 3 months before registration.\n* Any serious underlying medical condition (at the judgment of the investigator) which could impair the ability of the patient to participate in the trial (e.g. active autoimmune disease, uncontrolled diabetes).\n* Known hypersensitivity to trial drug(s) or hypersensitivity to any other component of the trial drugs.\n* Local tumor relapse only that is amenable to surgical treatment.\n* Previous treatment with formestane (4-OHA).\n* Radiotherapy (RT) within 4 weeks prior to treatment start .\n* Concurrent estrogen or progestin therapy in any formulation.\n* Any psychological, familial, sociological or geographical condition potentially hampering compliance with the trial protocol and follow-up.",
