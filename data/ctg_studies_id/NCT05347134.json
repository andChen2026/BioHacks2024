Males or females age 18 to 75 years old (inclusive) at the time of signing the informed consent form;\n2. Histologically and/or cytologically confirmed TNBC based on pathology reports on recent biopsy specimens or other pathological samples (central laboratory confirmation is not required), including:\n\n   1. Definition of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) negative: immunohistochemistry (IHC) of 0 or 1+; if HER is 2+ by IHC, negative HER2 expression must be confirmed by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH).\n   2. Estrogen and progesterone receptor negative means that less than 1% of the cells express hormone receptors as indicated by IHC;\n3. Patients with unresectable locally advanced or metastatic triple-negative breast cancer who have received at least two lines of standard of care regimens, including:\n\n   1. Any treatment received by the patients regardless of triple-negative state can be included as one of the standard of care regimens;\n   2. For patients whose treatment regimens have been changed due to intolerability to toxicity, the intolerable regimens can be included as one of the prior standard of care regimens;\n   3. For neoadjuvant and/or adjuvant chemotherapy, if relapse or disease progression to unresectable locally advanced or metastatic disease occurs during treatment or within 12 months after discontinuation of treatment (at least 2 cycles have been completed), it will be considered as one of the standard of care regimens. And the patients must also have received one therapy and have progressed on this therapy during the stage of unresectable locally advanced or metastatic disease;\n   4. For patients with documented germline BRCA1/BRCA2 mutations, if they have been treated with an approved PARP inhibitor, then the PARP inhibitor can be considered as one of the 2 prior standard of care regimens required;\n   5. Patients must have progressed on or were intolerable to the treatment during or after the last treatment prior to enrollment;\n4. All patients must have been previously treated with taxanes; and those who have been treated with taxanes for at least 1 cycle and show contraindications or intolerability during or at the end of the cycle can be included, regardless of the disease stage during this treatment;\n5. Patients must have at least one measurable lesion per RECIST v1.1 criteria; those with only skin or bone lesions cannot be included;\n6. Subjects with a Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 to 1 with an expected survival of \u2265 12 weeks;\n7. Subjects must provide tumor tissues or tissue specimens;\n8. Subjects must have adequate organ and bone marrow function (no blood transfusion, recombinant human thrombopoietin, or colony stimulating factor therapy has been received within 2 weeks prior to the screening), which is defined as follows:\n\n   1. Hematology: neutrophil count (NEUT) \u2265 1.5 \u00d7 109 /L; platelets (PLT) \u2265 100 \u00d7 109 /L; hemoglobin \u2265 9 g/dL;\n   2. Liver function: aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) \u2264 2.5 \u00d7 upper limit of normal (ULN); total bilirubin (TBIL) \u2264 1.5 \u00d7 ULN; for patients with liver metastases, ALT and AST must be \u2264 5 \u00d7 ULN, TBIL \u2264 2 \u00d7 ULN; for patients with liver or bone metastases, ALP must be \u2264 5 \u00d7 ULN;\n   3. Albumin \u2265 3 g/dL;\n   4. Renal function: creatinine clearance (Ccr) \u2265 60 ml/min (see Annex for Cockcroft-Gault formula);\n   5. Coagulation function: international normalized ratio (INR), activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) and prothrombin time (PT) \u2264 1.5 \u00d7 ULN;\n9. Subjects must have recovered from all toxicities (except alopecia) due to prior treatments to \u2264 grade 1 based on the assessment per CTCAE 5.0 criteria;\n10. Subjects voluntarily participate in the study, sign the informed consent form, and will be able to comply with the protocol-specified visits and relevant procedures.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\nSubjects who meet any of the following criteria will be excluded:\n\n1. Patients with a history of central nervous system (CNS) metastases or current CNS metastases;\n2. Patients with other malignancies, except cured basal or squamous cell skin cancer or in situ cancer of cervix; and patients with other malignancies must have a tumor-free period of at least 5 years;\n3. Patients with Gilbert's disease;\n4. Patients who have received prior TROP2-targeted therapy;\n5. Patients who have received live vaccines within 30 days prior to the first dose;\n6. Patients who required the treatment of strong inhibitors or inducers of cytochrome P450 3A4 enzyme (CYP3A4) within 2 weeks prior to the first dose and during the study treatment (strong inhibitors or inducers of CYP3A4 are not allowed in this study, and representative drugs of strong CYP3A4 inhibitors or inducers are listed in the Annex). Patients who received continued high dose of systemic corticosteroids within 2 weeks prior to the first dose (low-dose corticosteroids, such as \u2264 10 mg daily prednisone or equivalent, are allowed if the dose is stable for 4 weeks);\n7. Patients who have received any chemotherapy, hormonal therapy, radiotherapy, immunotherapy, biological therapy or other drugs within 4 weeks prior to the first dose of study treatment or within 5 half-lives of the drug used in the previous period (whichever is shorter), or received treatment with traditional Chinese medicine preparations for approved anti-tumor indications 2 weeks prior to the first dose of study treatment, or received major surgeries 4 weeks prior to the first dose of study treatment;\n8. With concomitant infections requiring systemic antibiotic therapy within 1 week prior to the first dose of study treatment;\n9.

Uncontrolled diabetes (fasting glucose \u2265 10 mmol/L and/or glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) \u2265 8%);\n10. Active hepatitis B (hepatitis B surface antigen positive, and HBV-DNA above 500 IU/ml or 1x ULN, whichever is higher) or hepatitis C (hepatitis C antibody positive, and HCV-RNA above 1x ULN); with known history of positive human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) test or known acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS); positive syphilis antibody test;\n11.
