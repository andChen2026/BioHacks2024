for recurrent /metastatic disease or have received one line of chemotherapy pending LDH \u2264 2 times upper limit of normal (ULN)\n\n    * One prior line of immunotherapy is allowed\n\nGeneral criteria:\n\n* Measurable disease, defined as unidimensionally measurable based on RECIST with a target lesion of at least 20 mm or 10 mm measured by spiral CT scan\n* Documented progressive disease proven by imaging prior to study entry (i.e., progression should be documented by 2 imaging scans performed within the past 6 months prior to registration showing progression according to RECIST)\n*

limited to, any of the following:\n\n  * Ongoing or active infection\n  * Symptomatic congestive heart failure\n  * Unstable angina pectoris\n  * Cardiac arrhythmia\n  * Psychiatric illness or social situation that would limit compliance with trial requirement or that are considered relevant for the evaluation of the efficacy or safety of the trial drug\n\nPRIOR CONCURRENT THERAPY:\n\n* See Disease Characteristics\n* At least 4 weeks since administration of any prior systemic treatment for the current malignancy including treatment with chemotherapy, radiotherapy, immunotherapy, hormonal therapy, and treatment with monoclonal antibodies, or small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors and others\n* No persistence of toxicities from prior anticancer therapy deemed clinically relevant\n* No treatment with any other investigational drug within the past four weeks or within less than four half-life times of the investigational drug before treatment with the trial drug (whatever is the longest period)\n* No major surgery within 4 weeks prior to the first treatment with the trial drug\n* Concurrent treatment with corticosteroids, including prednisone and bisphosphonates, is allowed as long as the treatment started before entry into the study and as long as the dose is stable for two weeks prior to enrollment in the present trial\n* Palliative radiotherapy may be given during the
