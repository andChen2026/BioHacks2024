    "eligibilityCriteria": "Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Histologically confirmed triple negative breast cancer (TNBC), defined as negative immunohistochemical staining for estrogen and progesterone receptors (\u22645% of nuclei positive by IHC) and receptor tyrosine-protein kinase erbB-2 (HER2) negative (IHC 0-1+ or HER2-neu negative according to American Society of Clinical Oncology; College of American Pathologists (ASCO-CAP) HER2 Test Guideline Recommendations)\n* Written informed consent in accordance with federal, local, and institutional guidelines\n* Body surface area \u22651.4 m\\^2\n* Age \u226518 years\n* Estimated life expectancy of \\>3 months at study entry\n* TNBC must be either locally recurrent or metastatic. Locally recurrent disease must not be amenable to surgical resection or radiation with curative intent.\n* Measurable disease by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1\n* Documented disease progression at study entry\n* Must have received at least 1 chemotherapy regimens in the setting of metastatic disease\n* Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of \u22642\n* Adequate hematological function: Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) \\> 1500/mm\\^3, platelets count \\>100,000mm\\^3\n* Adequate hepatic function within 14 days prior to Cycle 1 Day 1 (C1D1): total bilirubin \\<2 times the upper limit of normal (ULN) (except patients with Gilbert's syndrome who must have a total bilirubin of \\< 3 times ULN) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) \u22642.5 x ULN. In the case of known (radiological and/or biopsy documented) liver metastasis, AST/ALT \u22645.0 times ULN is acceptable.\n* Amylase and lipase \u2264 1.5 x ULN\n* Adequate renal function within 14 days prior to C1D1: estimated creatinine clearance of \u2265 30 mL/min\n* Women of child-bearing potential (WOCBP) must agree to use dual methods of contraception and have a negative serum pregnancy test at screening, and male participants must use an effective barrier method of contraception if sexually active with a female of child-bearing potential. For both male and female participants, effective methods of contraception must be used throughout the study and for 3 months following the last dose. To be considered of non-childbearing potential, postmenopausal women must be amenorrheic for at least 12 months naturally (not in the setting of post chemotherapy) or participants must be surgically sterile.\n* Must have received prior anthracycline and taxane therapy unless clinically contraindicated\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Significant medical illness that in the investigator's opinion cannot be adequately controlled with appropriate therapy or would compromise the participant's ability to tolerate this therapy\n* Women who are pregnant or lactating\n* Radiation, chemotherapy, or immunotherapy or any other approved anticancer therapy \u22642 weeks prior to cycle 1 day 1\n* Major surgery within 4 weeks before Day 1\n* Unstable cardiovascular function: Electrocardiogram (ECG) abnormalities requiring treatment, or congestive heart failure (CHF) of New York Hearth Association (NYHA) Class \u22653; myocardial infarction (MI) within 3 months\n* Uncontrolled infection requiring parenteral antibiotics, antivirals, or antifungals within one week prior to first dose. Potential participants with controlled infection or on prophylactic antibiotics are permitted in the study.\n* Known history of HIV\n* Known active hepatitis A, B, or C infection that requires treatment\n* Any underlying condition that would significantly interfere with the absorption of an oral medication\n* Grade \\>2 peripheral neuropathy at baseline (within 14 days prior to cycle 1 day 1)\n* Participation in an investigational anti-cancer study within 3 weeks prior to Cycle 1 Day 1\n* Coagulation problems and active major bleeding within 4 weeks prior to C1D1 (peptic ulcer, epistaxis, spontaneous bleeding)\n* Active central nervous system (CNS) malignancy. Asymptomatic small lesions are not considered active. Treated lesions may be considered inactive if they are stable for at least 3 months.\n* Radiation, chemotherapy, or immunotherapy or any other anticancer therapy \u2264 2 weeks prior to Cycle 1 Day 1 or radio-immunotherapy \u2264 4 weeks prior to Cycle 1 Day 1\n* Have not recovered to Grade \u2264 1 or to their baseline from clinically significant adverse effects",
