Co-administration of a targeted agent with the non-steroidal AI is permitted providing all toxicities have recovered to CTCAE Grade 1 or below 1 prior regimen of chemotherapy in the advanced setting is permitted. Chemotherapy administered in the adjuvant setting is permitted\n\n   Phase IIa:\n\n   o Progressing or progression at some point during breast cancer treatment on endocrine therapy with a non-steroidal AI.\\*\\*\\* Co-administration of a targeted agent with the non-steroidal AI is permitted providing all toxicities have recovered to CTCAE Grade 1 or below.\n   * Prior chemotherapy in the advanced and adjuvant setting is permitted.\n   * Prior treatment with exemestane with or without everolimus is permitted.\n\n     * Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor 2 (HER2) positive breast cancer patients should have been offered at least one prior line of HER2 directed therapy \\*\\*Advanced breast cancer: metastatic disease or locally advanced disease which is not amenable to treatment with curative intent \\*\\*\\*anastrozole or letrozole does not have to be the most recent therapy\n8.
