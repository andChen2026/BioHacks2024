Inclusion of adequately treated cervical carcinoma in situ or localized non-melanoma skin cancer is permitted independent of time since diagnosis\n* Previous therapy with more than 240 mg/m2 of doxorubicin or more than 450 mg/m2 of epirubicin\n* Previous radiotherapy for the metastatic disease (palliative radiotherapy of only non-target lesions is allowed)\n* Adjuvant treatment must have been stopped at least 6 months before registration\n* Any serious underlying medical condition (at the judgement of the investigator) which could impair the ability of the patient to participate in the trial (e.g. active autoimmune disease, uncontrolled diabetes, etc.)\n* Breastfeeding\n* Participation in any investigational drug trial within 4 weeks preceding treatment start\n* Any concomitant drugs contraindicated when administering Erbitux\u2122 or Caelyx\u2122 according to the Swissmedic-approved product information\n* Known hypersensitivity to trial drug(s) or to any component of the trial drug(s)\n* Any other serious underlying medical, psychiatric, psychological, familial or geographical condition, which in the judgment of the investigator may interfere with the planned staging, treatment and follow-up, affect patient compliance or place the patient at high risk from treatment-related complications.",
