    "eligibilityCriteria": "Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Locally-advanced or metastatic malignancy with an NTRK1, NTRK2, or NTRK3 gene fusion, identified through molecular assays as routinely performed at CLIA or other similarly-certified laboratories. Subjects who have an NTRK gene fusion identified in a lab where CLIA or equivalent certification cannot be confirmed by the Sponsor at the time of consent may have been enrolled in Cohort 9 as per protocol versions 1.0 - 8.0. From protocol version 9.0: CLIA or similar certification of the lab performing the fusion assay is required. However, patients may be included after discussion with the sponsor if the lab performing the fusion assay is not CLIA or similar certified.\n* Subjects who have received prior standard therapy appropriate for their tumor type and stage of disease, or who have no satisfactory alternative treatments and in the opinion of the Investigator, would be unlikely to tolerate or derive clinically meaningful benefit from appropriate standard of care therapy.\n* Subjects must have at least one measurable lesion as defined by RECIST v1.1 (Eisenhauer et al. 2009). Subjects with solid tumors without RECIST v1.1 measurable disease (e.g., evaluable disease only) had been eligible for enrollment to Cohort 8 as per protocol versions 1.0 - 8.0, regardless of tumor type. Subjects with primary CNS tumors should meet the following criteria:\n\n  1. Have received prior treatment including radiation and/or chemotherapy, with radiation completed \\> 12 weeks prior to C1D1 of therapy, as recommended or appropriate for that CNS tumor type.\n  2. Have \u2265 1 site of bi-dimensionally measurable disease (confirmed by magnetic resonance imaging \\[MRI\\] and evaluable by RANO criteria), with the size of at least one of the measurable lesions \u2265 1 cm in each dimension and noted on more than one imaging slice.\n  3. Imaging study performed within 28 days before enrollment. If on steroid therapy, the dose must be stable for at least 7 days immediately before and during the imaging study.\n  4. Must be neurologically stable based on stable neurologic exam for 7 days prior to enrollment.\n\n     For subjects eligible for enrollment to bone health cohort, inclusion criterion 3 is modified as the following:\n  5. Subjects must have at least one lesion at baseline (measurable or non-measurable as defined by RECIST v1.1 or RANO criteria, as appropriate to tumor type).\n  6. Subjects with primary CNS tumors must be neurologically stable based on stable neurologic exam for 7 days prior to enrollment.\n* At least 18 years of age\n* Performance Status: Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) score \u2264 3. If enrolled with primary CNS tumor to be assessed by RANO, Karnofsky Performance Score (KPS) \u2265 50%.\n* Tumor tissue before treatment (mandatory). If neither fresh tissue can be obtained nor archival tissue is available patients might be enrolled after consultation with the sponsor.\n* Adequate organ function as defined by the following criteria:\n\n  1. Serum AST and serum ALT \\< 2.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN), or AST and ALT \\< 5 x ULN if liver function abnormalities are due to underlying malignancy\n  2. Total bilirubin \\< 2.5 x ULN, except in the setting of biliary obstruction. Subjects with a known history of Gilberts Disease and an isolated elevation of indirect bilirubin are eligible\n  3. Serum creatinine \\< 2.0 x ULN OR an estimated glomerular filtration rate \u2265 30 mL/minute using the Cockcroft-Gault formula: (140- age) x body weight (kg) x 0.85 (if female)/serum creatinine (mg/dL) x 72 with either result acceptable for enrollment.\n* Ability to comply (or for guardian to ensure compliance) with outpatient treatment, laboratory monitoring, and required clinic visits for the duration of study participation.\n* Willingness of men and women of reproductive potential to use double effective birth control methods, defined as one used by the subject and another by his/her partner, for the duration of treatment and for 1 month following study completion.\n* For subjects eligible for enrollment to bone health cohort only: life expectancy of at least 6 months, based on investigator assessment.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Investigational agent or anticancer therapy within 2 weeks prior to the planned start of larotrectinib or 5 half-lives, whichever is shorter, and without recovery of acute and/or clinically significant toxicities from that therapy.\n* Prior progression while receiving approved or investigational tyrosine kinase inhibitors targeting TRK. Subjects who received less than 28 days of treatment and discontinued because of intolerance or toxicity are eligible.\n* Symptomatic or unstable brain metastases. (Note: Subjects with asymptomatic brain metastases are eligible to participate in the study.) Subjects with primary CNS tumors are eligible.\n* Uncontrolled concurrent malignancy that would limit assessment of efficacy of larotrectinib. Allowed conditions may include, but are not limited to in situ cancers of cervix, breast, or skin, superficial bladder cancer, limited-stage prostate cancer, and basal or squamous cancers of the skin.\n* Active uncontrolled systemic bacterial, viral, or fungal infection CTCAE grade \u2265 2; unstable cardiovascular disease, or other systemic disease that would limit compliance with study procedures. Unstable cardiovascular disease is defined as:\n\n  1. In adults, persistently uncontrolled hypertension defined as systolic blood pressure (BP) \\> 150 mmHg and/or diastolic BP \\> 100 mmHg despite antihypertensive therapy.\n  2. Myocardial infarction within 3 months of screening.\n  3. Stroke within 3 months of screening.\n* Inability to discontinue treatment with a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor or inducer\n* Currently recovering from AEs/ ADRs due to previous treatments (excluding alopecia). Inclusion is only advised once the AE/ADR resolves or recovers to baseline or at least to CTCAE grade 1.\n* Known or suspected hypersensitivity against the active substance or any of the ingredients of the IMP.\n* Known history of HIV infection. All patients must be screened for HIV up to 28 days prior to study drug start using a blood test for HIV according to local regulations.\n* HBV or HCV infection. All patients must be screened for HBV and HCV up to 28 days prior to study drug start using the routine hepatitis virus laboratorial panel. Patients positive for HBsAg or HBcAb will be eligible if they are negative for HBVDNA. Patients positive for anti-HCV antibody will be eligible if they are negative for HCV-RNA.",
