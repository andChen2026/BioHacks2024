An archival tu-mor sample may be submitted (\\<6 months); however, if one is not available, a newly obtained tumor biopsy specimen must be submitted instead\n8. Measurable disease according to RECIST1.1\n9. Symptomatic, untreated, or actively progressing central nervous system (CNS) metasta-ses are not eligible. Patients with a history of treated CNS lesions are eligible, provided all of the following criteria are met:\n\n   1. Measurable or non-measurable disease, per RECIST v. 1.1, must be present outside the CNS\n   2. No history of intracranial haemorrhage or spinal cord haemorrhage\n   3. Metastases are limited to the cerebellum or the supratentorial region (i.e., no metasta-ses to the midbrain, pons, medulla, or spinal cord).\n   4. There is no evidence of interim progression between completion of CNS-directed ther-apy and the screening brain scan.\n   5. The patient has not received stereotactic radiotherapy within 7 days prior to initiation of study treatment or whole-brain radiotherapy within 14 days prior to initiation of study treatment.\n   6. The patient has no ongoing requirement for corticosteroids as therapy for CNS disease. Anticonvulsant therapy at a stable dose is permitted.\n\nAsymptomatic patients with CNS metastases newly detected at screening are eligible for the study after receiving radiotherapy or surgery, with no need to repeat the screening brain scan.\n\n10. Patients must have an estimated survival of at least 3 months 11. WHO performance status (ECOG) from 0 to 1 12.

Adequate hepatic function : total serum bilirubin \u2264 1x ULN, or total bilirubin \u2264 2.0 x ULN with direct bilirubin within normal range in patients with well documented Gilbert's Syndrome, ALAT and ASAT \u2264 1.5 x ULN 14. Adequate renal function: serum creatinine \u2264 1.5 \u00d7 ULN or creatinine clearance \u2265 60mL/min 15.

A WOCBP must have a negative pregnancy test (highly sensitive urine test or serum test as required by local regulations) within 72 hours before the first dose of study treatment.\n\n  19. Male participants are eligible to participate if they agree to the following during the interven-tion period and for at least 90 days after the last dose of study treatment:\n* Refrain from donating sperm\n* Must agree to use a male condom (and should also be advised of the benefit for a female partner to use a highly effective method of contraception as a condom may break or leak) 20.
