a pregnancy test (serum or urine) will be administered every 3 weeks if their menstrual cycles are regular or every 2 weeks if their cycles are irregular while on study within the 24-hour period prior to the administration of RO4929097 and /or cediranib; a positive urine test must be confirmed by a serum pregnancy test; prior to dispensing RO4929097 and /or cediranib, the investigator must confirm and document the patient's use of two contraceptive methods or abstinence, dates of negative pregnancy test, and confirm the patient's understanding of the teratogenic potential of RO4929097 and cediranib\n  * Female patients of childbearing potential are defined as follows:\n\n    * Patients with regular menses\n    * Patients, after menarche with amenorrhea, irregular cycles, or using a contraceptive method that precludes withdrawal bleeding\n    * Women who have had tubal ligation\n  * Female patients may be considered to NOT be of childbearing potential for the following reasons:\n\n    * The patient has undergone total abdominal hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy or bilateral oophorectomy\n    * The patient is medically confirmed to be menopausal (no menstrual period) for 24 consecutive months\n    * Pre-pubertal females; the parent or guardian of young female patients who have not yet started menstruation should verify that menstruation has not begun; if a young female patient reaches menarche during the study, then she is to be considered as a woman of childbearing potential from that time forward\n* Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document\n* Archival tissue availability with consent for pharmacodynamic analysis is highly preferred but NOT an inclusion criterion\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Patients who have had systemic therapy or radiotherapy or major surgery within 4 weeks (6 weeks for nitrosoureas or mitomycin C) prior to entering the study or those who have not recovered from adverse events due to agents administered more than 4 weeks earlier\n* Patients may not be receiving any other investigational agents within the past 30 days or have been previously treated with a gamma-secretase inhibitor and/or cediranib;
