Consent for fresh tumour biopsy samples at baseline and on trial (may be Investigator mandated for patients in the dose escalation phase; mandatory for a minimum of eight patients in each expansion cohort). Investigators will consider whether a biopsy is feasible for the patient in the dose escalation phase and this will not impede participation in the trial if biopsy is not a suitable option.\n5. Life expectancy estimated by the Investigator to be at least 12 weeks.\n6. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0-1.\n7. Cohort 1M/2M (TT-702 monotherapy) - Aged 16 years or over at the time consent is given.\n8.

Note: patients initially diagnosed with hormone receptor-positive and/ or HER2-positive breast cancer OR de novo metastatic patients with a primary tumour hormone receptor-positive (weak positivity or ER negativity and progesterone receptor positivity) considered as nonclinically relevant are eligible if the tumour biopsy obtained from a local recurrence or distant metastasis site confirms the TNBC disease.\n* ER and progesterone receptor negativity (\\<1% positive staining cells in the invasive tumour) determined locally using IHC per American Society of Clinical Oncology/College of American Pathologists criteria.\n* Patients who have received prior anti-PD-1/anti-PD-L1 agent must have experienced Investigator-assessed initial clinical benefit from the most recent anti-PD-1/anti-PD-L1 treatment (either as monotherapy or in combination with other compounds) for at least 10 weeks, followed by subsequent progression. Initial benefit is defined as SD or better with an anti-PD-1/anti-PD-L1 therapy.\n\nCohort 2A (TT-702 \\& darolutamide combination cohort): mCRPC.\n\n* Patients with mCRPC must have progressive disease according to PCWG3 criteria.\n* Previously irradiated lesions cannot be counted as target lesions unless clearly progressed after radiotherapy.\n* Patients undergoing biopsy should have at least two lesions, one to be used as a target lesion and one to be biopsied.\n* Cohort 2P (TT-702 \\& PD-1/PD-L1 combination cohort): MMR/MSI defective tumours, TNBC or mCRPC.\n\nExclusion criteria:\n\n1. Radiotherapy (except single fractions for palliative reasons), endocrine therapy during the previous four weeks, immunotherapy and chemotherapy during the previous four weeks(previous six weeks for nitrosoureas, Mitomycin-C) before receiving TT-702. A washout period of eight weeks is required for enzalutamide and apalutamide before the patient receives their first dose of TT-702. A washout period of 4 weeks or 5 half-lives whichever is shorter for any other previous preceding IMPs is required before the patient receives their first dose of TT-702 (in the combination cohorts no washout is needed from PD-1/PD-L1 and darolutamide, respectively).\n2. Patients with ongoing toxic manifestations of previous treatments greater than NCI CTCAE Version 5.0 Grade 1. Exceptions to this are alopecia and any ongoing toxic manifestation which in the opinion of the Investigator should not exclude the patient.\n3. Patients with symptomatic brain or leptomeningeal metastases should be excluded. Asymptomatic patients with previously treated and stable brain metastases (in previous four weeks to study entry) and not requiring any steroids are eligible for the trial. Patients who are stable on anticonvulsants are also eligible.\n4. Cohort 1M/2M (monotherapy) - Women of childbearing potential (or are already pregnant or lactating). However, those patients who meet the following points are considered eligible:\n\n   \u2022 Have a negative highly sensitive pregnancy test of a serum sample within 7 days prior to trial inclusion; and\n\n   \u2022 Agree to use two forms of medically approved contraception: i. one highly effective form including but not limited to: oral, injected,implanted, transdermal or intravaginal hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of ovulation; intrauterine device; intrauterine hormonereleasing system, bilateral tubal occlusion or vasectomised partner; ii. plus a barrier method (for example, condom plus spermicide); iii. or agree to sexual abstinence.

Is a participant or plans to participate in another interventional clinical trial, whilst taking part in this Phase I/II trial of TT-702. Participation in an observational trial or interventional clinical trial which does not involve administration of an IMP and which would not place an unacceptable burden on the patient in the opinion of the Investigator would be acceptable.\n12. Previous malignancies of other types, apart from adequately treated in situ carcinoma of the cervix uteri and basal or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin. Cancer survivors, who have undergone potentially curative therapy for a prior malignancy, have no evidence of that disease for five years or more and are deemed at negligible risk for recurrence, are eligible for the trial.\n13.
