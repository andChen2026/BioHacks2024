Fresh tissue must be obtainable at baseline or fresh tissue biopsy prior to treatment initiation.\n* Patients who will undergo surgical treatment with either segmental resection or total mastectomy.\n* Patients must have adequate hematologic, hepatic, and renal function. All tests must be obtained less than 4 weeks from study entry.

If patient is judged to be at risk for having had exposure to viral B or C hepatitis (i.e. illicit IV drug use, blood transfusion prior to 1990, body piercing, tattoos, etc.), appropriate testing should be performed (i.e. Hepatitis B surface antigen antibody, and Hepatitis C antibody)\n* Active or uncontrolled infection requiring parenteral antibiotics.\n* Dementia, altered mental status, or any psychiatric condition that would prohibit the understanding or rendering of informed consent.\n* Symptomatic neuropathy (\u2265 grade 2).\n* Concurrent anti-cancer therapy (chemotherapy, radiation therapy, surgery, immunotherapy, hormonal therapy, or any other biologic therapy) other than the ones specified in the protocol.\n* Concurrent treatment with an investigational agent.\n* Used an investigational drug within 15 days or 5 half-lives, whichever is longer, preceding the first dose of randomized therapy.",
