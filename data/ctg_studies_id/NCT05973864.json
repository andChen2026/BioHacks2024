Has a known additional malignancy, excepted skin basal cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma of the skin, or in situ cervical cancer or previously treated malignancy with no evidence of disease for \u2265 2 years;\n4. Presents a contraindication to continue pembrolizumab treatment as per respective summary of product characteristics (SmPC) including known hypersensitivity;\n5. Previous immune-related adverse event of any grade due to pembrolizumab that led to permanent discontinuation of pembrolizumab;\n6. Presents a contraindication to capecitabine treatment as per SmPC;\n7. Complete Dihydropyrimidine Dehydrogenase (DPD) deficiency;\n8. Require the use of one of the following forbidden treatments during the study treatment period:\n\n   * Any investigational anticancer therapy other than the protocol specified treatment,\n   * Any concurrent chemotherapy, immunotherapy, biologic for cancer treatment, other than the ones stated in the protocol;\n9.
