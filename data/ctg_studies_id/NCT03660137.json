Pre-operative MRI is at the discretion of the treating surgeon\n* The primary lesion must be visible on ultrasound OR mammogram\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Biologically male patients\n* Multifocal or multi-centric cancer requiring bracketing or multiple resections for complete excision\n* Locally advanced malignant breast cancer\n* Any absolute contraindications to BCS\n* Pregnancy or lactation\n* Unable or unwilling to undergo follow-up at Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre\n* Prior allergy to magnetic seed components (nickel) or any part of the delivery system",
