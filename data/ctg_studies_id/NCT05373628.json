    "eligibilityCriteria": "Inclusion Criteria:\n\n1. Breast cancer was confirmed by operation or biopsy;\n2. The status of estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), human epidermal growth factor-2 (HER-2), Ki-67 and lymphatic vessel invasion (LVI) in breast cancer were clearly diagnosed by pathology;\n3. Routine MRI and mean cell size imaging sequence scanning were performed within 1 week before pathological examination\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n(1) Breast cancer patients who had received treatment before mean cell size imaging sequence scanning; (2) Patients who had undergone breast tumor puncture within 2 weeks before the mean cell size imaging sequence scan; (3) Patients with breast masses without surgery or biopsy after mean cell size imaging sequence scanning; (4) The breast mass was confirmed to be other diseases except breast cancer by pathological examination; (5) The image quality is poor due to motion artifacts or other reasons, so the average cell size imaging post-processing cannot be carried out.",
