    "eligibilityCriteria": "Inclusion Criteria:\n\n1. (Turnstile One - Applies only to inclusion criteria 1 - 4): Histologically confirmed breast cancer and evidence of metastatic disease that can be biopsied with acceptable risk. Patients must agree to mandatory fine needle aspiration of the cancer for response marker determination. Patient must have a positive gene expression profile. Positive gene expression signature obtained separately on trial LAB11-0337 will also be acceptable for eligibility.\n2. Patients must have measurable or evaluable disease as defined by the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria.\n3. Subject, age \\> 18 years (the safety and efficacy of dasatinib and the appropriate dose has not been established for children).\n4. Signed written informed consent including a HIPAA form according to institutional guidelines.\n5. (Turnstile Two Applies Only to Inclusion Criteria 5 -17) - Therapy with Dasatinib - Patient must have a positive gene expression profile. Positive gene expression obtained separately on trial LAB11-0337 will also be acceptable for eligibility.\n6. Performance status Zubrod scale 0-2 (Appendix B) within 8 days of starting therapy.\n7. Full physical examination and history including documentation of weight, height, and vital signs within 8 days of starting therapy.\n8. Patients may have received any number of previous therapies for metastatic breast cancer. Patients must have received, had a contraindication to, or declined treatment with an anthracycline and taxane (and Herceptin if HER-2 positive) in either the adjuvant or metastatic setting.\n9. Adequate organ function assessed within 14 days of study therapy, defined as: (a)Total bilirubin \\</= 2.0 times the institutional Upper Limit of Normal (ULN); (b) Hepatic enzymes (AST, ALT ) \\</= 2.5 times the institutional ULN; (c) Serum Na, K+, Mg2+, Phosphate and Ca2+ \\>/= lower limit of normal (LLN); (d) Serum Creatinine \\< 1.5 time the institutional ULN; and (e) Hemoglobin, Neutrophil count, Platelets, PT, PTT all Grade 0-1.\n10. A baseline EKG within 14 days of starting therapy, with a QTc interval not \\> 460 msec in women, or \\> 450 in men.\n11. Ability to take oral medication (dasatinib must be swallowed whole).\n12. Patient must agree to discontinue St. Johns Wort while receiving dasatinib therapy if previously taken.\n13. Patient must agree that IV bisphosphonate therapy will be withheld for the first 8 weeks of dasatinib therapy due to risk of hypocalcemia. (After the need for Ca2+ supplementation has been assessed and levels documented to be \\>LLN, subjects on prior bisphosphonate may be restarted with caution at the investigator's discretion).\n14. Females of childbearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test within 7 days of starting therapy.\n15. Persons of reproductive potential must agree to use and utilize a barrier method of contraception throughout treatment and for at least 4 weeks after study drug is stopped.\n16. Concurrent medications must be assessed, and patient must agree to discontinue all restricted medications within 7 days of starting therapy.\n17. Stable brain metastasis for at least 3 months\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n1. (Only turnstile II applies to Exclusion Criteria): Known allergy to study drug.\n2. Concurrent medical condition which may increase the risk of toxicity, including: (a) pleural or pericardial effusion of any grade; (b) uncontrolled angina, congestive heart failure or MI within (6 months); (c) history of congenital long QT syndrome or prolonged QTc interval on pre-entry electrocardiogram \\> 460 msec in women and \\>450 msec. in men; (d) any history of clinically significant ventricular arrhythmias (such as ventricular tachycardia, ventricular fibrillation, or Torsades de pointes); continued in excl # 3\n3. Continued from exclusion # 2: (e) subjects with hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia if it cannot be corrected prior to dasatinib administration; (f) history of significant bleeding disorder unrelated to cancer, including diagnosed congenital bleeding disorders (e.g., von Willebrand's disease) or acquired bleeding disorder within one year (e.g., acquired anti-factor VIII antibodies); (g) ongoing or recent (3 months) significant gastrointestinal bleeding\n4. Concomitant medications with any of the following drugs should be considered for exclusion unless discontinued 7 days prior to starting dasatinib: (a) Category I drugs that prolong QT interval and are generally accepted to have a risk of causing Torsades de Pointes including: quinidine, procainamide, disopyramide, amiodarone, sotalol, ibutilide, dofetilide, erythromycin, clarithromycin, chlorpromazine, haloperidol, mesoridazine, thioridazine, pimozide, cisapride, bepridil, droperidol, methadone, arsenic, chloroquine, and domperidone. Cont. in exclusion # 5\n5. Continued from exclusion criterion # 4: halofantrine, levomethadyl, pentamidine, sparfloxacin, lidoflazine.\n6. CYP3A4 inhibitors. Dasatinib is primarily metabolized by the CYP3A4 enzyme. Therefore, potent inhibitors of CYP3A4 may increase dasatinib plasma concentrations: (i) ketoconazole, itraconazole, erythromycin, clarithromycin,ritonavir, atazanavir, indinavir, nefazodone, nelfinavir, saquinavir; (ii) telithromycin; and (iii) subjects should be advised not to consume substantial quantities of grapefruit juice.\n7. Medications which durably inhibit platelet function or inhibit anticoagulation. Medications which directly and durably inhibit platelet function or coagulation include: (i) aspirin or aspirin-containing combinations, clopidogrel, dipyridamole, tirofiban, dipyridamole, epoprostenol, eptifibatide, cilostazol, abciximab, ticlopidine, cilostazol; and (ii) warfarin, heparin/low molecular weight heparin \\[e.g., danaparoid, dalteparin, tinzaparin, enoxaparin\\]. Exceptions: low-dose warfarin for prophylaxis to prevent catheter thrombosis, and heparin for flushes of IV lines is allowed.\n8. Women who are unwilling or unable to use a barrier method of contraception to avoid pregnancy for the entire study period and for at least 4 weeks after cessation of study drug, or have a positive pregnancy test at baseline, or are pregnant or breast-feeding. Prior to study enrollment, women of childbearing potential must be advised of the importance of avoiding pregnancy during trial participation and the potential risk factors for an unintentional pregnancy.\n9. Prisoners or subjects who are compulsorily detained (involuntarily incarcerated) for treatment of either a psychiatric or physical (e.g., infectious) illness.\n10. Exclusion from Selumetinib therapy include Uncontrolled hypertension (BP \\>/=150/95 mmHg), Heart failure (NYHA \\>/= Class II), prior or current cardiomyopathy (LVEF \\</= 50%), Atrial fibrillation (heart rate \\>100 bpm), Unstable ischaemic heart disease (MI within 6 months prior, or angina requiring use of nitrates more than once weekly).",
