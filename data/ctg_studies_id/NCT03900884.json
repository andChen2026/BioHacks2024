Age \\<60 years and have cessation of regular menses for at least 12 consecutive months with no alternative pathological or physiological cause and have serum levels of oestradiol and FSH within the reference range for postmenopausal females.\n4. If pre or peri menopausal, patients must be willing to receive ovarian suppression/ablation, commencing \u226528 days prior to first dose of treatment.\n5. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status score \u2264 1. (Appendix 1).\n6. Patient must have histological or cytological confirmation of metastatic carcinoma of the breast (either from the primary or metastatic site) or locally advanced breast cancer not amenable to surgical or local therapy with curative intent, with the following tumour molecular characteristics (as determined from pre-screening testing):\n\n   1. ER positive (defined as \u226510% positive stained carcinoma cells).\n   2. BCL-2 positive (defined as \u226550% cells with at least moderate cytoplasmic staining; intensity 2-3 on a 0-3 scale).\n   3. HER2 non-amplified (per ASCO/CAP guidelines).\n7. Patients must be willing to provide tissue after two weeks of treatment from a newly obtained core or excisional biopsy of a tumour lesion where feasible. Patients for whom a repeat biopsy cannot be provided (e.g. inaccessible or patient safety concern) may be eligible only upon agreement from the Coordinating Principal Investigator.\n8. Patients have received no more than a total of two prior lines of systemic therapy for metastatic breast cancer. This can include one line of chemotherapy.\n9. Patients must have measurable disease (according to RECIST v1.1) or evaluable disease. Bone-only metastases are allowed.\n10. Patents must have adequate organ and bone marrow function as defined below within 14 days prior to registration:\n\n    * Haemoglobin \u2265 90 g/L.\n    * Absolute neutrophil count \u2265 1.5 x 109/L.\n    * Platelet count \u2265 100 x 109/L.\n    * ALT and AST \u2264 2.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN), or \u2264 5 x ULN if liver metastases are present.\n    * Total serum bilirubin \u2264 1.5 x ULN. Patient's with Gilbert's syndrome may have a total serum bilirubin \\> 1.5 x ULN.\n    * Creatinine Clearance \u2265 50 mls/min (Cockcroft-Gault, please see Appendix 2).\n11. Female patients of childbearing potential must have negative urine or serum pregnancy test within 14 days prior to registration.\n12. Life expectancy \\> 6 months.\n13. Patient is able to swallow whole tablets.\n14. Female patients of childbearing potential must be willing to use at least one of the following methods of contraception for the course of the study through to 30 days after the last dose of study medication:\n\n    * Total abstinence from sexual intercourse as the preferred lifestyle of the patient (periodic abstinence is not acceptable).\n    * Intrauterine device (IUD) or Mirena.\n    * Double-barrier method (contraceptive sponge, diaphragm or cervical cap with spermicidal jellies or cream and a condom).\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n1. Patients who have previously been exposed to venetoclax (ABT-199) or a CDK4/6 inhibitor (in the adjuvant or metastatic setting).\n2. Patients who are pregnant or lactating.\n3. Patients with evidence of CNS metastases.\n4. Receipt of any anti-cancer therapy received within 21 days of registration including chemotherapy, radiotherapy, endocrine therapy (aromatase inhibitors, Selective Estrogen Receptor Modulator such as tamoxifen, or a Selective Estrogen Receptor Degrader such as fulvestrant) or other investigational therapy. The following therapies ARE permitted:\n\n   1. Bisphosphonate or denosumab therapy for patients with bone metastases.\n   2. Ovarian suppression in pre- and peri-menopausal patients.\n5. Prior radiotherapy to a target lesion site, unless there has been unequivocal progression at that site following radiotherapy.\n6. Patients who are taking warfarin or other oral anticoagulant therapy. The use of alternative anticoagulation therapy such as systemic low-molecular weight heparin will be acceptable.\n7. Patients who have had major surgery within 28 days of first dose of study drug or anticipation of the need for major surgery during the course of study treatment.\n8. Patients that have received any of the following agents within 7 days prior to registration:\n\n   1. Steroid therapy for anti-neoplastic intent.\n   2. CYP3A inhibitors e.g. fluconazole, ketoconazole, clarithromycin.\n   3. Potent CYP3A inducers e.g. rifampicin, carbamazepine, phenytoin, St. John's Wort.\n   4. Drugs that are known to prolong the QT interval (see Appendix 5).\n9. Consumption of one or more of the following within 3 days prior to the first dose of study drugs:\n\n   1. Grapefruit or grapefruit products.\n   2. Seville oranges including marmalade containing Seville oranges.\n   3. Star fruit (carambola).\n10. Need for current chronic corticosteroid therapy (\u226510 mg of prednisone per day or an equivalent dose of other corticosteroids).\n11. Patients with active uncontrolled infection.\n12.
