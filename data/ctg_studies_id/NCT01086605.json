Histologically or cytologically confirmed adenocarcinoma of the breast and clinical evidence of metastatic breast cancer.\n4. Pre-treatment requirements:\n\n   4.1. Must have been previously treated in neoadjuvant, adjuvant or metastatic setting with anthracycline and/or taxane.\n\n   4.2. Must have received 2-3 prior chemotherapy treatment regimens NOTE: If NO prior (neo)adjuvant chemotherapy, patient must have received a minimum of 2 prior chemotherapy regimens in the metastatic setting.\n\n   4.2.1 NOTE: If prior (neo)adjuvant chemotherapy HAS been given, patient must have received at least 1 prior chemotherapy regimen in the metastatic setting.\n\n   4.3. Prior hormonal therapy allowed in the neo-adjuvant, adjuvant, or metastatic setting.\n\n   Unlimited prior hormonal therapy is allowed.\n5. Patients must have measurable disease as defined in the protocol.\n6. Negative pregnancy test done \u22647 days prior to registration, for women of childbearing potential only.\n7. The following laboratory values obtained \u226415 days prior to registration.\n\n   7.1 Hemoglobin \u226510.0g/dL\n\n   7.2 ANC \u22651500/mm\\^3\n\n   7.3 Platelet count \u2265100,000/mL\n\n   7.4 Total bilirubin \u22641.5 x ULN)\n\n   7.5 SGOT (AST) and SGPT (ALT) \u22645 x ULN\n\n   7.6 Serum creatinine \u22641.5 x ULN\n8.

Willingness to return to NCCTG enrolling institution for follow-up.\n\nRegistration and Randomization - Exclusion Criteria\n\n1.

Has already received lifetime cumulative treatment with doxorubicin equivalent to \\>400 mg/m2.\n5. \\>3 prior chemotherapy regimens for breast cancer.\n\n   5.1 NOTE: This number includes (neo)adjuvant chemotherapy, if given. If (neo)adjuvant chemotherapy HAS been given it counts as one (1) regimen.\n6. Major surgery, chemotherapy, or immunologic therapy \u22643 weeks prior to registration.\n\n   6.1 NOTE: If patient has received prior treatment with bevacizumab, treatment on this trial should not begin until \u22654 weeks after the last dose of bevacizumab.\n7. Radiotherapy \u22644 weeks prior to registration, except if to a non-target lesion only.\n\n   7.1 Prior radiation to a target lesion is permitted only if there has been clear progression of the lesion since radiation was completed.\n\n   7.2 If patient receives single dose radiation for palliation or radiation to non-target lesion, they may immediately proceed to registration without waiting.\n\n   7.3 Acute adverse events from radiation must have resolved to \u2264Grade 1 (according to current version of NCI CTCAE).\n8. Evidence of active brain metastasis including leptomeningeal involvement.\n\n   8.1 CNS metastasis controlled by prior surgery and/or radiotherapy is allowed.

Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active infection or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements.\n12. Co-morbid systemic illnesses or other severe concurrent disease which, in the judgment of the investigator, would make the patient inappropriate for entry into this study or interfere significantly with the proper assessment of safety and toxicity of the prescribed regimens.\n13. History of allergy or hypersensitivity to drug product excipients or agents chemically similar to pixantrone.\n14.
