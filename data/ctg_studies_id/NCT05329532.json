Patient has at least one measurable lesion per RECIST 1.1 criteria by computed tomography scan or magnetic resonance imaging (non-neoadjuvant cohorts).\n7. Wherever possible, patients not scheduled for curative intent resection surgery should have a fresh tumour biopsy (or have an archival biopsy \\[obtained within the past 5 years\\] if obtaining a fresh biopsy is not feasible) at baseline for molecular studies, and agree to a post-treatment biopsy (at Week 25 or the end of treatment visits), if feasible. Patients in the SCCHN neoadjuvant cohort must have both a fresh pre-treatment biopsy and agree to have their resected tumour analysed.\n8. Patient is male or female and at least 18 years of age.\n9.
