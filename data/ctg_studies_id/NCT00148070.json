    "enrollmentCount": 45,
    "primaryOutcomeMeasure": "To assess whether assignment of docetaxel dose based on the ERMBT will result in decreased variability in drug area under the curve when compared to dosing based on body surface area.",
    "eligibilityCriteria": "Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Patients with biopsy proven, measurable metastatic breast cancer. Patients with bone-only, and/or effusion-only disease are excluded.\n* Karnofsky performance status equal to 70 or greater.\n* ANC \\> 1500, Hgb \\> 10, plt \\> 100.\n* Patients with some degree of hepatic dysfunction and renal dysfunction are encouraged, in order to evaluate the ability of the ERMBT in tailoring dose in these patient populations.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Age less than 18 years.\n* Allergy to erythromycin.\n* Previous treatment with docetaxel. Prior paclitaxel is allowed.\n* Grade \\> 2 peripheral neuropathy.\n* No confounding factors present to provide misinterpretation of data (i.e., concurrent malignancy).\n* Patients who are pregnant or nursing will not be eligible for this protocol. Women of childbearing age who are not practicing reliable birth control must have a documented negative serum HCG.\n* Patients who require concurrent treatment with drugs which are known to induce or inhibit CYP3A activity will be ineligible for the trial. This list includes the drugs midazolam, anti-mycotic agents (ketoconazole and related compounds), macrolide antibiotics (erythromycin and related compounds), nifedipine, anti-seizure drugs, and rifampin (induction).",
