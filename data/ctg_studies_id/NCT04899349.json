Relapsed with documented evidence of progression while on (neo) adjuvant endocrine-based therapy or within 12 months from completion of (neo) adjuvant endocrine-based therapy with no treatment for metastatic disease.\n  2. Relapsed with documented evidence of progression more than 12 months from completion of (neo) adjuvant endocrine-based therapy and then subsequently progressed with documented evidence of progression while on or after only one line of endocrine-based therapy for metastatic disease.\n  3. Newly diagnosed advanced breast cancer, then relapsed with documented evidence of progression while on or after only one line of endocrine-based therapy.\n\nNote: Participants with newly diagnosed endocrine-based treatment na\u00efve advanced breast cancer were NOT included in the study.\n\n* Participants might or might not have received prior CDK4/6i therapy. If prior CDK4/6i therapy was administered, it may have been in the adjuvant or metastatic setting.\n* If female, the participant was postmenopausal.\n* Participant had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1.\n* Participant had adequate bone marrow and organ function.\n\nKey Exclusion Criteria:\n\n* Participant relapsed with documented evidence of progression more than 12 months from completion of (neo) adjuvant endocrine therapy with no treatment for metastatic disease.\n* Participant had more than 1 line of prior treatment in the metastatic setting.\n* Participant had received prior treatment with chemotherapy (except for neoadjuvant/adjuvant chemotherapy), any PI3K, Mammalian Target of Rapamycin (mTOR) or Protein Kinase B (Akt) inhibitor.\n* Participant had inflammatory breast cancer at screening.\n* Participants with an established diagnosis of diabetes mellitus type I or participants with type II diabetes mellitus requiring antihyperglycemic therapy.\n* Participant had a history of acute pancreatitis within 1 year of screening or a past medical history of chronic pancreatitis.\n* Participant had currently documented pneumonitis/interstitial lung disease.\n* Participant had a history of severe cutaneous reaction, such as Steven-Johnson Syndrome (SJS), erythema multiforme (EM), Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis (TEN) or Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Syndrome (DRESS).",
