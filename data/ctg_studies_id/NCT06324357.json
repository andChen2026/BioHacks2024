Further inclusion criteria apply.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Previous or concomitant malignancies other than the one treated in this trial within the previous 2 years, which require current systemic therapy except:\n\n  * effectively treated non-melanoma skin cancers\n  * effectively treated carcinoma in situ of the cervix\n  * effectively treated ductal carcinoma in situ\n  * other effectively treated malignancy that is considered cured by local treatment\n* History or presence of cardiovascular abnormalities such as uncontrolled hypertension, congestive heart failure New York Heart Association (NYHA) classification of \u2265 III or IV, unstable angina or poorly controlled arrhythmia which are considered as clinically relevant by the investigator. Myocardial infarction (or troponin levels consistent with myocardial infarction within 28 days of randomization), stroke, or pulmonary embolism within 6 months prior to randomization.\n* Any clinically important abnormalities (as assessed by the investigator) in rhythm, conduction, or morphology of resting electrocardiograms, e.g. complete left bundle branch block, third degree heart block.\n* Mean resting corrected QT interval (QT interval corrected for heart rate by Fridericia\u00b4s formula (QTcF)) \\>470 msec.\n* Any factors that increase the risk of QT interval corrected for heart rate (QTc) prolongation or risk of arrhythmic events such as heart failure, hypokalemia, congenital long QT syndrome, family history of long QT syndrome or unexplained sudden death under 40 years-of-age. Or any concomitant medication known to prolong the QT interval.\n* Ejection fraction \\<50% or the lower limit of normal of the institutional standard within 28 days prior to randomization.\n* Women who are pregnant, nursing, or who plan to become pregnant or nurse during the trial or within 7 months after the last dose of trial treatment with T-DXd or T-DM1.\n\nFurther exclusion criteria apply.",
