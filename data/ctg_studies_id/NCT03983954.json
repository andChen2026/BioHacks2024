The following are exceptions to this criterion:\n\n   1. Patients with Graves' disease, vitiligo or psoriasis not requiring systemic treatment (within the last 2 years).\n   2. Patients with endocrinopathies (e.g. following Hashimoto syndrome) stable on hormone replacement or do not require any therapy.\n4.

Female patients who are pregnant or breastfeeding or male or female patients of reproductive potential who are not willing to employ effective birth control from screening to 90 days after the last dose of study treatment (either durvalumab monotherapy or durvalumab + Nap combination therapy).\n\n    \\* Highly effective methods of contraception are defined as one that results in a low failure rate (e.g., less than 1% per year) when used consistently and correctly. Note that some contraception methods are not considered highly effective (e.g., male or female condom with or without spermicide; female cap, diaphragm, or sponge with or without spermicide; non-copper containing intrauterine device; progestogen-only oral hormonal contraceptive pills where inhibition of ovulation is not the primary mode of action \\[excluding Cerazette/desogestrel which is considered highly effective\\]; and triphasic combined oral contraceptive pills).\n13.
