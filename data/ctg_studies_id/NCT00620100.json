Prior therapy for advanced or recurrent disease\n2. Previous cumulative exposure to epirubicin \\> 600 mg/m\u00b2 or to doxorubicin \\> 300 mg/m\u00b2\n3. Previous radiation therapy having involved more than 25% of bone marrow; incomplete recovery from toxicity of radiation therapy\n4. Symptomatic brain metastases and clinically diagnosed leptomeningeal metastases\n5. Isolated unmeasurable bone lesions, serous pleural effusion or pulmonary lymphangiitis (i.e., unmeasurable disease according to the RECIST guidelines)\n6. Pre-existing motor or sensory neurologic toxicity of a severity \\> than or = to grade 2 according to NCI-CTC AE criteria version 3.0\n7. Pregnant or lactating women or women of childbearing potential not using adequate contraception\n8. Other serious illness or medical conditions, including:\n\n   1. Congestive heart failure or unstable angina pectoris, previous history of myocardial infarction within 1 year from study entry, uncontrolled hypertension or high-risk uncontrolled arrhythmias\n   2.

Definite contraindications for the use of corticosteroids\n12. Likelihood of requiring treatment during the study period with drugs not permitted by the clinical study protocol (see Section 6.2)\n13. Concurrent treatment with other investigational drugs. Active treatment as part of another clinical therapeutic trial within 30 days prior to study entry\n14. Concurrent treatment with any other anti-cancer therapy, except adjuvant hormone therapy started \\> than or = to 12 months prior to study enrollment. Bisphosphonates for management of bone metastases or osteoporosis/osteopenia are allowed\n15. History of hypersensitivity to docetaxel (or drugs formulated in polysorbate 80), epirubicin or doxorubicin\n16. Mental condition rendering the subject unable to understand the nature, scope, and possible consequences of the study\n17. Subject unlikely to comply with protocol, e.g., uncooperative attitude, inability to return for follow-up visits, and unlikelihood of completing the study\n\nThe above information is not intended to contain all considerations relevant to a patient's potential participation in a clinical trial.",
