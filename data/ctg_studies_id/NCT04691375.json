Subjects without an archival tissue sample will only be eligible if they choose and consent to provide a CNB of primary or a metastatic lesion required for part B, used in Part A only if an archival specimen unavailable.\n* Subjects must have documented disease progression (including prior treatment with a CPI (alone or in combination), if approved for that indication.\n* There is no limit to the number of prior treatments.\n* Measurable disease by RECIST 1.1\n* All acute toxic effects of any prior antitumor therapy, including immunotherapy, have resolved to Grade \\< 2 before the start of study drug dosing (including Grade \\< 2 alopecia or peripheral neuropathy, or if controlled on thyroid replacement therapy).\n* Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status (PS) \u2264 2\n* Coagulation: International Normalized Ratio (INR) \u2264 1.3, unless on a therapeutic anticoagulant\n* Adequate hematologic function defined as follows: Platelets \u2265 100 x 10\\^9/L; Hemoglobin \u2265 8.0 g/dL; ANC \u2265 1.5 x 10\\^9/L (without granulocytic growth factors within the previous 7 days of obtaining the screening hematologic laboratory values)\n* Adequate hepatic function defined as follows: AST / ALT \u2264 2.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN) (if liver metastases are present, \u2264 5 x ULN); Total or conjugated bilirubin \u2264 1.5 x ULN\n* Adequate renal function defined as follows: Serum Creatinine \u2264 2 x ULN or creatinine clearance (CrCl) \u226545 mL/min as calculated by the Cockroft-Gault method\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Subject is a candidate for molecularly targeted therapy (e.g., drugs targeting EGFR, VEGF, ALK, ROS-1, NTRK, MET, RET and BRAF V600E, HER2). Applies to enrolled subjects on both Part A and Part B of the study.\n* History of autoimmune disorder requiring ongoing or intermittent disease-modifying therapy excluding thyroid disease otherwise well controlled on replacement therapy\n* Stable treated or asymptomatic brain metastases for at least 3 months documented by brain imaging prior to enrollment\n* Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, active SARS-CoV-2 infection, active or chronic bleeding event within 28 days prior to first dose of study drug, or psychiatric illness/social situation that would limit compliance with study requirements as judged by treating physician\n* Decompensated liver disease as evidenced by hepatic encephalopathy or coagulopathy\n* Active angina or Class III or IV CHF (NYHA CHF Functional Classification System) or clinically significant cardiac disease within 12 months of first dose of study drug, including MI, unstable angina, Grade 2 or greater peripheral vascular disease, CHF, uncontrolled HTN, or arrhythmias not controlled by medication\n* Any anti-cancer therapy, including small molecules, immunotherapy, chemotherapy, monoclonal antibody therapy (except for bone-modifying agents as supportive care), radiotherapy, or any other agents to treat cancer within 21 days (dependent upon the agent and drug half-life), of first dose of study drug\n* Refractory lung cancer subjects who have progressed within 3 months of initiating chemotherapy-doublet regimens or lung cancer subjects who have progressed within 6 months of initiation immunotherapy-chemotherapy combination treatment.\n\nNote: Other protocol defined Inclusion/Exclusion criteria may apply.",
