A minimum of 21 days since the last dose of chemotherapy must have elapsed prior to registration.\n* No prior therapy with a c-Met inhibitor or angiogenesis inhibitor. Other targeted agents are permissible provided a minimum of 21 days has elapsed since last day of targeted therapy and registration.\n* Prior radiation therapy permitted provided the patient has recovered from acute toxic effects of the radiation therapy prior to registration, and at least 21 days have elapsed from the day of the last fraction of radiation to the date of registration. Exceptions may be made for non-myelosuppressive radiation to peripheral areas.\n* Previous surgery permitted provided wound healing has occurred and at least 14 days have elapsed if surgery was major.\n* Granulocytes (AGC) \u2265 1.5 x 109/L; Platelets \u2265 100 x 109/L\n* Serum creatinine \u2264 1.2 x UNL; Total bilirubin \u2264 1.2 x UNL; ALT and AST \u2264 2 x UNL\n* Women must be post menopausal, surgically sterile or use a reliable form of contraception while on study and for 90 days after discontinuing therapy.

(Patients with neurologically stable and treated brain metastases who have discontinued corticosteroids at least two weeks prior to study registration and have no evidence of cavitation or hemorrhage are eligible).\n* Untreated and/or uncontrolled cardiovascular conditions and/or have symptomatic cardiac dysfunction. Patients with a significant cardiac history (even if controlled) or prior anthracycline exposure are required to have an LVEF \\> 50%.\n* GI tract disease resulting in an inability to absorb oral medication.\n* Active or uncontrolled infections, or with serious illnesses or medical conditions which would not permit the patient to be managed according to the protocol.\n* Known hypersensitivity to the study drugs or their components.\n* Potent CYP3A4 inhibitors/inducers (e.g. ketoconazole, carbamazepine) must be discontinued at least 7 days prior to Day 1, Cycle 1.\n* Treatment, concurrent or within 3 weeks prior to registration, with other investigational drugs or anti-cancer therapy.\n* Proliferative diabetic retinopathy, retinal arteritis or hemorrhage.\n* History of pulmonary embolus or a deep vein thrombosis diagnosed and/or treated within 6 months prior to registration.",
