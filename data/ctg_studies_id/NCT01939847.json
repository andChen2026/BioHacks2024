For HER2 assessment, a negative result is an immunohistochemical (IHC staining of 0 or 1+, a FISH result of less than 4.0 HER2 gene copies per nucleus, or a FISH ratio of less than 1.8. ER/PR will be assessed by IHC and will be defined as positive/negative using the American Society of Clinical Oncology/College of American Pathologists (ASCO-CAP) Guidelines. Estrogen receptor (ER) and progesterone receptor (PR) assays will be considered positive if there are at least 1% positive tumor nuclei in the sample on testing in the presence of expected reactivity of internal (normal epithelial elements) and external controls. NOTE: A triple negative clinical phenotype based upon the patient's clinical course may also be eligible as determined at the discretion of the Study Chair (ie, if a patient is behaving clinically as ER/PR negative but does not meet the strict criteria outlined.)\n* Patients must have a tumor suitable for biopsy and be deemed medically appropriate to undergo a biopsy\n* Able to voluntarily provide informed consent\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* N/A\n\nMOLECULAR PROFILING IN BLOOD:\n\nInclusion Criteria:\n\n* Male or Female\n* 18 years of age or older\n* Metastatic breast cancer\n* Any phenotype of breast cancer is eligible for enrollment (i.e., any ER, PR, and HER2 status).\n* Able to voluntarily provide informed consent\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* N/A",
