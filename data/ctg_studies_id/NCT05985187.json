Patients with the following two conditions can be enrolled: other malignancies treated with a single operation, achieving continuous 5-year disease-free survival (DFS); Cured cervical carcinoma in situ, non-melanoma skin cancer and superficial bladder tumors \\[Ta (non-invasive tumor), Tis (cancer in situ) and T1 (tumor infiltrating basal membrane)\\];\n* Major surgical treatment, open biopsy, or significant traumatic injury (except for diagnostic biopsies for primary breast cancer) received within 28 days before the start of study treatment;\n* A wound or fracture that has not healed for a long time.\n* Arteriovenous thrombosis occurred within 6 months, such as cerebrovascular accident (including temporary ischemic attack, cerebral hemorrhage, cerebral infarction), deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism;\n* Subject who have a history of psychotropic substance abuse and are unable to abstain or have mental disorders;\n* Subjects with any severe and/or uncontrolled disease, including:\n\n  1.
