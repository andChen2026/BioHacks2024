    "eligibilityCriteria": "Inclusion Criteria:\n\nPatients are eligible to be enrolled for randomization in the study only if they meet all of the following criteria:\n\n1. Written informed consent prior to any specific study procedures, showing patient willingness to comply with all study procedures.\n2. Histologically or cytologically documented locally recurrent inoperable or metastatic breast cancer with HER2+ status based on local laboratory determination, preferably on the most recent available FFPE tumor sample, and according to American Society of ClinicalOncology (ASCO)/College of American Pathologists (CAP) international guidelines valid at the time of the assay. In case of discordance in HER2+ status in different biopsies, we will consider the result from the most recent biopsy one will be used.\n3. Documented HR status based on local laboratory, preferably on the most recent available FFPE tumor sample, and according to ASCO/CAP international guidelines valid at the time of the assay. In case of discordance in HR status in different biopsies, the result from the most recent biopsy will be used. HR+ will be defined as \u22651% positive cells by immunohistochemistry for Estrogen Receptor (ER) and/or Progesterone Receptor (PgR). HR- will be defined as \\<1% positive cells by immunohistochemistry for both ER and PgR. Considering that there are limited data on endocrine therapy benefit for cancers with 1% to 10% of cells staining ER positive, for the purpose of this study, patients with ER and PgR expression between 1 and 10% (considered to be HR low by the most recent ASCO/CAP guidelines) will be eligible for inclusion in the HR- cohort.\n4.
