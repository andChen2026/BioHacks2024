to be considered controlled, there must be at least 2 months of no symptoms or evidence of progression prior to study entry and corticosteroid therapy given to control brain edema must have been discontinued\n* History of allergy or hypersensitivity to the drugs used in this study (or their excipients) including platinum compounds (cisplatin, carboplatin)\n* Active, unresolved infection\n* Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to psychiatric illness/social situations or co-morbid systemic illnesses or other severe concurrent disease which, in the judgment of the investigator, would make the patient inappropriate for entry into this study or would interfere significantly with the proper assessment of safety of the prescribed regimens or would limit compliance with study requirements or would make it undesirable for patient to participate in the trial\n* Clinically significant cardiovascular or cerebrovascular disease, including any history of the following =\\< 6 months prior to registration:\n\n  * Myocardial infarction\n  * Unstable angina\n  * New York Heart Association (NYHA) class II or greater congestive heart failure\n  * Uncontrolled or clinically significant cardiac arrhythmia (patients with controlled atrial fibrillation are eligible)\n* Currently receiving treatment in a different clinical study in which investigational procedures are performed or investigational therapies are administered\n\n  \\* NOTE: Patient may not enroll in such clinical trials while participating in this study; exception may be granted for trials related to symptom management (cancer control) which do not employ hormonal treatments or treatments that may block the path of the targeted agents used in this trial\n* Immunocompromised patients (other than that related to the use of corticosteroids) including patients known to be human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) positive with an acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS)-defining illness; HIV positive patients with cluster of differentiation (CD)4 count within institutional normal range and no history of an AIDS-defining illness are eligible",
