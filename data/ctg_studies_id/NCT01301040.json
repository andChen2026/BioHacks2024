    "eligibilityCriteria": "1. Patient selection criteria\n\n   * Female aged equal or more than 65 years.\n   * Histological diagnosis of early BC for which the treating physician considers (neo) adjuvant chemotherapy to be beneficial. Recommended situations are:\n   * Triple negative BC if pT \\> 1cm.\n   * HER-2 positive BC if pT1 \\> 1cm; and trastuzumab will be given after study chemotherapy.\n   * \"Luminal B\" cancers defined as ER+, PgR + or neg, Ki-67 \u2265 14%, and pT1 \\> 1cm.\n   * \"Luminal A\" cancers (ER+, PgR+ and Ki-67 \\< 14%) will be considered only if \u2265 4 nodes.\n   * Poor response to a preoperative endocrine therapy.\n   * WHO performance status equal or less than 1.\n   * Baseline LVEF equal or more than 50% measured by echocardiography.\n   * Adequate organ function including:\n   * neutrophils more or equal to 1.5 x 109/L.\n   * platelets more or equal to100 x 109/L.\n   * bilirubin \\< 1.25 x upper limit of normal (ULN) for the institution.\n   * transaminases: AST \\< 2.5 x ULN , ALT \\< 2.5 x ULN and alkaline phosphatase \u2264 2.5 x ULN for the institution.\n   * Estimated creatinine clearance \\> 30ml/min (using the Crockoft and Gault formula) (See Appendix E) .\n   * No previous exposure to chemotherapy in this neoadjuvant or adjuvant setting.\n   * No serious cardiac illness or medical conditions as judged by the investigator including, but not confined to:Symptomatic ventricular arrhythmias,Clinical and/or ECG evidence of myocardial infarction within the last 12 months,Coronary artery disease requiring medication,High-risk uncontrolled arrhythmias,Poorly controlled hypertension (e.g. systolic \\>180 mm Hg or diastolic \\>100 mm Hg).\n   * Other concurrent serious diseases that may interfere with planned treatment including severe pulmonary conditions/illness.\n   * No participation to other clinical trials involving therapeutic agents within the 6 weeks prior to the randomization.\n   * No prior or concurrent diagnosis of cancer, except for adequately treated basocellular and squamous cell carcinoma of the skin or cervical uterine in situ tumor\n   * Absence of any psychological, familial, sociological or geographical condition potentially hampering compliance with the study protocol and follow-up schedule; those conditions should be discussed with the patient before registration in the trial.\n   * Signed written informed consent must be given according to ICH-GCP and national/local regulations, prior to any study specific screening procedures and randomization.\n2. Caregiver selection criteria\n\n   * to be identified by participating patients as their primary caregivers i.e the person who helps them the most to cope with cancer in their everyday life\n   * to be at least eighteen years old\n   * to be aware of the cancer diagnosis of the patients to be fit enough to complete the questionnaires\n   * to be French speaking\n   * to be free of any cognitive dysfunction.\n   * to give their written informed consent as regards participation in the study.",
