Subjects who have been treated with other antineoplastic agents such as chemotherapy, radical radiotherapy, or immunotherapy within 4 weeks prior to randomization, or who are still within 5 half-lives of the drug (whichever occurs shortest);\n  2. Treatment with endocrine therapy, molecularly targeted therapy, or a proprietary Chinese medicine with an anti-tumor indication as specified in the National Medical Products Administration (NMPA) approved drug insert within 2 weeks prior to randomization;\n  3. Presence of carcinomatous lymphadenitis, or uncontrollable pleural effusion, ascites, and pericardial effusion of moderate volume or greater that requires repeated drainage to relieve clinical symptoms, or who have received drainage of plasmapheresis for therapeutic purposes within 2 weeks prior to randomization;\n  4. Known carcinomatous meningitis or clinically active central nervous system metastases;\n  5. Severe bone damage resulting from tumor bone metastases;\n* Those who have received a control chemotherapeutic agent of the investigator's choice during the recurrent metastatic phase or for whom a control chemotherapeutic agent of the investigator's choice is inappropriate for reasons such as intolerance or contraindication to that agent;\n* Has received prior anti-HER2 therapy;\n* Who have developed hypersensitivity to humanized monoclonal antibody products;\n* Those who have developed an allergy to any of the study drugs or any component or excipient in the drugs;\n* Who have participated in and used another antitumor clinical trial drug within 4 weeks prior to randomization;\n* Subjects who, in the judgment of the investigator, have a concomitant disease that seriously jeopardizes the safety of the subject or interferes with the completion of the study, or who are deemed to have other reasons for being unsuitable for enrollment.",
