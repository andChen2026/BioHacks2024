Subjects must give informed consent to the study before the study entry and voluntarily sign a written informed consent form;\n3. Breast cancer subjects diagnosed by pathology\uff08histology or cytology\uff09;\n4. ER positive and HER2 over-expression (immunohistochemical IHC test 3+ and/or in situ hybridization ISH test positive)\uff1bPrevious test results are acceptable.\n5. Advanced/metastatic breast cancer that has previously received treatment failure with trastuzumab (or trastuzumab biosimilar) regimen;Or (new) adjuvant therapy during treatment with trastuzumab (or trastuzumab biosimilar) or within 12 months after the end of treatment, disease recurrence or progression\uff1bPatients with first-line systemic treatment for relapse (previously received trastuzumab or trastuzumab biosimilars)\uff1bOr patients who are not suitable for trastuzumab treatment\uff1bPatients who have failed previous anti-HER2-ADC drug therapy can also be included.\n6. At least one lesion (measurable and/or non-measurable) that can be evaluated by CT/MRI and meets the reproducible evaluation requirements of RECIST V1.1;\n7. ECOG Performance Status of 0-1;\n8. The estimated survival time is more than 3 months;\n9. Postmenopausal women\n\n   Postmenopausal is defined as meeting any one of the following four conditions:\n\n   Past bilateral oophorectomy; Age \u226560 years old; Age \\<60 years old, natural menopause \u226512 months, in the past 1 year without chemotherapy, tamoxifen, toremifene or ovarian castration, the level of follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) and estradiol Within the postmenopausal range (use the reference range of the local laboratory).\n\n   Patients younger than 60 years old who are taking tamoxifen or toremifene, their FSH and estradiol levels are within the postmenopausal range (use the reference range of the local laboratory); Premenopausal or perimenopausal women who do not meet the above-mentioned menopausal criteria can also be included in this study, but they must also receive ovarian suppression therapy that meets the standards of medical or surgical castration treatment. Drug ovarian suppression therapy has been started at least 21 days before the start of this program, and Must be continued during the treatment plan;\n10.

All previous treatment-related toxicities must be CTCAE (version 5.0) \u2264 Grade 2 at the time of randomization, except for hair loss, pigmentation, and long-term toxicity caused by radiotherapy (which cannot be recovered by the investigator's judgment)\uff1b\n12. Women patients of childbearing age (including their partners) have no pregnancy plan and voluntarily take effective contraceptive measures from the signing of the informed consent form to 3 months after the last medication.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n1. Patients with visceral crisis\uff08Visceral crisis is defined as the dysfunction of several organs confirmed by symptoms, signs, laboratory tests, and rapid disease progression.Visceral crisis does not simply refer to the presence of visceral metastases, but to critical visceral conditions that require rapid and effective treatment to control the disease progression, especially when the opportunity for chemotherapy is lost after progression\uff09\n2. Patients with the presence of spinal cord compression or brain, meningeal metastases\n3. Patients who have been treated with a small molecule HER2 tyrosine kinase inhibitor (HER2-TKI) (medication course \u22642 weeks is excluded)\n4. Have received radiotherapy within 4 weeks prior to study\uff1b\n5. Have received chemotherapy for advanced breast cancer\\> 1 lines (the subjects who have used chemotherapy drugs must have stopped the chemotherapy drugs for \u2265 4 weeks before being enrolled in this study);\n6. Patients with parenteral nutrition; malabsorption syndrome; or any condition possibly affecting drug absorption or inability to tolerate oral medications;\n7.
