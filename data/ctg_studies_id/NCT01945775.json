A repeat CT or MRI following the identification of CNS metastases (obtained at least 2 weeks after definitive therapy) must document adequately treated brain metastases.\n  * Subjects with leptomeningeal carcinomatosis are not permitted\n* Prior malignancy except for any of the following:\n\n  * Prior BRCA-associated cancer as long as there is no current evidence of the cancer\n  * Carcinoma in situ or non-melanoma skin cancer\n  * A cancer diagnosed and definitively treated \u2265 5 years before randomization with no subsequent evidence of recurrence\n* Known to be human immunodeficiency virus positive\n* Known active hepatitis C virus, or known active hepatitis B virus\n* Known hypersensitivity to any of the components of talazoparib",
