    "eligibilityCriteria": "Inclusion Criteria:\n\nTo be eligible for participation in the study, patients must meet the following inclusion criteria:\n\n* Locally-advanced or metastatic solid tumor with an NRG1 gene fusion identified through molecular assays, such as PCR, NGS (RNA or DNA) or FISH, by a CLIA-certified or similarly accredited laboratory\n* Availability of fresh or archived FFPE tumor sample to be submitted to a central laboratory for confirmation of NRG1 gene fusion status\n* Patients should have received a minimum of one prior standard therapy appropriate for their tumor type and stage of disease, progressed or been nonresponsive to these available therapies, with no further available curative therapy options\n* \u2265 18 years of age\n* ECOG performance status (PS) 0, 1 or 2\n* Patients must have at least one measurable extra-cranial lesion as defined by RECIST v1.1\n* Adequate hepatic function defined as:\n* Serum AST and serum ALT \\< 2.5 \u00d7 upper limit of normal (ULN), or AST and ALT \\< 5 \u00d7 ULN if liver function abnormalities due to underlying malignancy\n* Total bilirubin \\< 2.0 ULN. Subjects with a known history of Gilberts Disease and an isolated elevation of indirect bilirubin are eligible\n* Adequate hematologic status, defined as:\n* Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) \u22651.5 \u00d7 109/L not requiring growth factor support for at least 7 days prior to Screening, and\n* Platelet count \u2265100.0\u00d7109/L not requiring transfusion support for at least 7 days prior to Screening\n* Able to provide informed consent or have a legal representative able and willing to do so\n* Ability to comply with outpatient treatment, laboratory monitoring, and required clinic visits for the duration of study participation\n* Willingness of men and women of reproductive potential to observe conventional and effective birth control for the duration of treatment and for 3 months following study completion; this may include barrier methods such as condom or diaphragm with spermicidal gel.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Known, actionable oncogenic driver mutation other than NRG1 fusion where available standard therapy is indicated\n* Life expectancy \\< 3 months\n* Pregnant or lactating\n* Prior treatment with ERBB3/HER3 directed therapy (Cohort 1 only)\n* Prior treatment with pan-ERBB or any ERBB/HER2/HER3 directed therapy (Cohort 1 only)\n* Symptomatic or untreated brain metastases (Note: Patients with asymptomatic brain metastases treated with radiation or surgery and without evidence of progression by imaging at screening are eligible to participate in the study. Patients requiring ongoing corticosteroids to treat brain metastases will not be eligible).\n* Received other investigational agent or anticancer therapy within 28 days prior to planned start of seribantumab or 5 half-lives, whichever is shorter\n* Prior to initiation of seribantumab treatment, patients must have recovered from clinically significant toxicities from prior anticancer or investigational therapy\n* Any other active malignancy requiring systemic therapy\n* Known hypersensitivity to any of the components of seribantumab or previous CTCAE grade 3 or higher hypersensitivity reactions to fully human monoclonal antibodies\n* Clinically significant cardiac disease, including symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina, acute myocardial infarction within 12 months of planned first dose, or unstable cardiac arrhythmia requiring therapy (including torsades de pointes)\n* Active uncontrolled systemic bacterial, viral, or fungal infection\n* Patients who are not appropriate candidates for participation in this clinical study for any other reason as deemed by the investigator",
