    "eligibilityCriteria": "This study will enroll approximately 170 patients with measurable advanced, refractory breast cancer \\[BC\\] (incurable stage III and stage IV) histologically confirmed and with ECOG performance status of 0, 1 and 2 who:\n\n* are primarily diagnosed with advanced disease or are diagnosed with incurable recurrent disease and who have progressed at least 2 standard systemic treatments (with different treatment regimens)\n* have not refused standard-of-care therapies\n\n  * Prior radiation therapy is allowed, provided that the patient has recovered from any toxic effects thereof; radiotherapy will not be counted as the treatment line\n  * Chemotherapy regimens will be counted based on interval disease progression, and not on the number of agents or the number of switches in agents\n  * Patients with ER+ tumors must have failed at least one line of palliative endocrine treatment .\n  * Patients with HER2+ tumors must have failed at least two lines of palliative anti-HER2 therapy\n\nInclusion Criteria:\n\n1.

This applies only to patients who are not receiving therapeutic anticoagulation agents.\n   9. Patients receiving therapeutic anticoagulation agents must be on a stable dose\n   10. Calcium level within normal ranges.\n10. The last dose of prior systemic anticancer therapy must have been administered \u2265 7 days prior to study treatment initiation\n11. Measurable disease, as defined by RECIST v1.1\n12. ECOG performance status 0, 1 or 2.\n13. Patients with asymptomatic CNS metastases (treated or untreated), as determined by CT or MRI evaluation during screening and prior radiographic evaluation, are eligible.\n14. For women of childbearing potential: agreement to remain abstinent (refrain from heterosexual intercourse) or use double barrier contraceptive methods that result in a failure rate of \\< 1% per year during the treatment period and for at least 6 months after the last dose of chemotherapy.\n15. Patients must have recovered (i.e., improvement to Grade 1 or better) from all acute toxicities from previous therapy, excluding alopecia. If a patient was previously treated with taxanes, the patient must have recovered from any adverse effects or remain at an acceptable level for patient (i.e. peripheral neuropathy).\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n1. Symptomatic CNS metastases\n2. Subjects with brain metastases at screening must have clinically controlled neurologic symptoms and have received previous adequate treatment, defined as surgical excision and/or radiation therapy with stable neurologic function and no evidence of CNS disease progression as determined by comparing a computed tomography (CT) scan or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan performed during screening to a prior scan performed at least 4 weeks earlier and provided that the subject is asymptomatic, has no evidence of cavitation or hemorrhage, and does not require corticosteroids;\n3. Leptomeningeal disease\n4. Uncontrolled pericardial effusion or ascites requiring recurrent drainage procedures\n5.
