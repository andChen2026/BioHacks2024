Women suffering from moderate to severe vaginal dryness according to the FDA guidelines for drug development in postmenopausal women (Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, (CDER) Jan 2003). A moderate symptom will be considered if the symptom is present, bothersome and annoying, and a severe symptom will be considered if the symptom is present, bothersome and annoying, and interferes with the normal patient activity.\n7. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status (ECOG PS) of 0 or 1.\n8. Adequate bone marrow as defined by the following laboratory values:\n\n   1. Absolute Neutrophil Count (ANC) \u2265 1.5 x 109/L.\n   2. Platelets (plt) \u2265 100 x 109/L.\n   3. Hemoglobin (Hgb) \u2265 10 g/dl.\n9. Patient has adequate organ function as defined by the following laboratory values:\n\n   1. Serum creatinine \u2264 1.5 x Upper Limit of Normal (ULN).\n   2. Bilirubin \u2264 1.5 \u00d7 ULN.\n   3.

Willingness and ability to comply with scheduled visits, treatment plan, laboratory tests and other study procedures.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n1. Stage IIIB-IV breast cancer or bilateral breast cancer.\n2. Treatment with any other current anti-tumoral therapy (chemotherapy, anti-Her2...etc) besides the NSAI. Pamidronate or Alendronate are permitted.\n3. Prior history of other malignancy within 5 years of study entry, aside from non-melanoma skin cancer or carcinoma-in-situ of the uterine cervix adequately treated.\n4. Postmenopausal uterine bleeding. Vaginal bleeding of unknown etiology.\n5. Patients with endometrial thickness equal to or greater than 4 mm measured by transvaginal ultrasound.\n6. Patients who have received any type of vulvovaginal treatment in the 15 days prior to the start of the study.\n7. Use of any hormone, natural (phytoestrogens) or herbal products for the treatment of menopausal symptoms within the last 3 months.\n8.
