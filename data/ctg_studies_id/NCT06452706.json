Received endocrine therapy or traditional Chinese patent medicines and simple preparations with anti-tumor indications specified in the National Medical Products Administration (NMPA) approved drug directions within 2 weeks before the first drug use;\n  3. Imaging shows that the tumor has invaded important blood vessels, or the researcher determines that the tumor is highly likely to invade important blood vessels and cause fatal massive bleeding during subsequent studies;\n  4. Uncontrollable pleural effusion, ascites, and moderate or higher amounts of pericardial effusion that require repeated drainage;\n  5. Known presence of cancerous meningitis or clinically active central nervous system metastasis;\n  6. Severe bone damage caused by tumor bone metastasis.
