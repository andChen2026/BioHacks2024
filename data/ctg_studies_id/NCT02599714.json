    "eligibilityCriteria": "Inclusion:\n\n1. Signed and dated written informed consent prior to any mandatory study specific procedures, sampling and analyses.\n2. Signed and dated written informed consent for tumour biopsies. If the tumour is found not to be safely accessible the biopsy will not be taken. Accessible lesions are defined as those which are biopsiable and amenable to repeat biopsy, unless clinically contraindicated.

Other prior anticancer therapy (e.g. tamoxifen) are also allowed.\n\nFor inclusion in the optional research component:\n\n1. Genetic research: Provision of signed and dated written consent for genetic research sampling and analyses. If a patient declines to participate in genetic component of the study, there will be no penalty or loss of benefit to the patient.
