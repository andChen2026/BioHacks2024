The subject voluntarily joined the study and signed the informed consent form.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n1. Uncontrolled central nervous system metastasis (defined as symptoms or requiring glucocorticoids or mannitol to control symptoms);\n2. Clinically symptomatic third space effusion, pericardial effusion, pleural effusion and abdominal effusion that cannot be controlled by pumping or other treatments;\n3.
