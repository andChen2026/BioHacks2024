This must be confirmed by agreement by two named consultant breast surgeons, a multidisciplinary team meeting (including at least one consultant breast surgeon) or by formal anaesthetic assessment. Unsuitability for surgery under local anaesthetic must be confirmed by a consultant breast surgeon.\n* or - The patient refuses to undergo surgery. This must be confirmed by a consultant surgeon and breast care nurse following full discussion of the treatment options.\n* or - The patient is considered unlikely to benefit from surgical removal of the cancer by virtue of known metastatic disease or other life-shortening condition. This must be confirmed by discussion in a multidisciplinary team meeting which includes an oncologist.\n* The patient has given written informed consent for the study Women who are already on primary endocrine therapy for a breast cancer and meet the inclusion criteria will also be eligible.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* The patient is on anticoagulants or has a known clotting disorder\n* Pregnancy or lactation\n* Allergy to local anaesthetic",
