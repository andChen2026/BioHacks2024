    "eligibilityCriteria": "Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Patients must be female\n* Participants must have a pre-operative standard mammogram with or without ultrasound. These may be performed at outside institutions.\n* Participants must have biopsy confirmed and clinical stage 1 or stage 2 breast carcinoma. If biopsy was done at an outside hospital, pathology will be reviewed at BWH/DFCI.\n* Participants must be candidates for definitive local therapy with breast conserving therapy (this takes into account tumor to breast size ratio appropriate for BCS, and the ability to undergo standard radiation therapy post-operatively).\n* Patient must meet standard MRI guidelines and be able and willing to undergo MRI\n* Age \u226518 years and \\< 75.\n* Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Participants with a known BRCA 1 or 2 mutation.\n* Participants with known Li-Fraumeni or Cowden's Disease.\n* Participants with prior mantle radiation.\n* Participants with locally advanced breast cancer such as inflammatory breast cancer or cancer grossly involving skin.\n* Participants who are pregnant.\n* Participants who enroll in a preoperative therapy trial or who have been treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy.\n* Participants with known active collagen vascular disease.\n* Participants with prior history of ipsilateral breast carcinoma.\n* Patients who have biopsy confirmed multi-centric disease.\n* Participants who have documented contra-indications for contrast-enhanced MRI, including but not limited to renal failure.\n* Participants who exceed the weight limit for the surgical table at AMIGO, 350 lbs or who will not fit into the 70 cm diameter bore of the MRI scanner at AMIGO or the 60 cm diameter bore of the pre-procedure imaging MRI scanner.",
