Primary tumor completely resected (deep margins and overlying skin involvement allowed if fully resected)\n7. Patients who will begin an adjuvant hormone therapy or have received a maximum of 4 years of adjuvant hormone therapy. Hormone therapy could be either +/- LH-RH agonists, letrozole, anastrozole or exemestane.\n8. No clinically or radiologically detectable metastases at time of inclusion.\n9.

Any clinical or radiological suspicion of malignant or pre-malignant disease in the contralateral breast\n3. Patients with pN1mi as sole nodal involvement\n4. Previous cancer (excepted basal cell carcinoma of the skin or in situ carcinoma of the cervix) in the preceding 5 years, including invasive contralateral breast cancer\n5. Patient already included in another ongoing therapeutic trial involving an unlicensed drug for which follow-up is required\n6. Patient who is pregnant or breast-feeding. Adequate birth control measures should be taken during the study treatment phase\n7. Patient with significantly impaired lung function (e.g. Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease, respiratory insufficiency, Interstitial Lung Disease)\n8. Positive serology for HIV infection or hepatitis C\n9. Chronic carrier of HBV (positive Antigen HbsAg positive in the blood)\n10. Patient with chronic infection\n11.

Known hypersensitivity to the active substance, to other rapamycin derivatives or to any of the excipients\n14. Patient with other concurrent severe and/or uncontrolled medical disease or infection which could compromise participation in the study (e.g. patient who regularly require systemic steroids to control co-morbid disease)\n15. Patient with any psychological, familial, social or geographical condition which could potentially hamper compliance with the study protocol and follow-up schedule; those conditions should be discussed with the patient before registration in the trial",
