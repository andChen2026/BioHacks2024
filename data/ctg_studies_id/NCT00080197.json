alkaline phosphatase \\<= 3 times ULN and alanine transaminase (ALT) and aspartate transaminase (AST) \\<= 3 times ULN, unless related to liver metastasis, in which case \\<= 5 x ULN,\n* Patients must have serum electrolytes including calcium (corrected for albumin), magnesium, and potassium (corrected) within normal limits,\n* Patients must be willing and able to complete the FACT-B questionnaire,\n* Patients must be willing and able to comply with the study protocol for the duration of the study, and\n* Patients must give written informed consent prior to any study specific screening procedures with the understanding that the patient may withdraw consent at any time without prejudice.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Patients must not have metastatic disease that can be completely surgically resected,\n* Patients who received adjuvant taxane must not have experienced disease progression within 12 months of beginning that therapy,\n* Patients must not have received chemotherapy, hormonal therapy, or Herceptin within 2 weeks of E7070 treatment start and must have recovered from any chemotherapy-related or other therapy-related toxicity at study entry,\n* Patients must not have received investigational drugs including immunotherapy, gene therapy, or other biologic therapy; antineoplastic therapy; or radiation therapy (other than required for palliation of bone pain or chest ulceration) within 2 weeks of E7070 treatment,\n* Patients must not have received prior treatment with Mitomycin C or nitrosoureas,\n* Patients must not have undergone high dose chemotherapy with hematopoietic stem cell rescue,\n* Patients must not have untreated brain metastases (Patients who have been treated for central nervous system (CNS) metastases must be asymptomatic and radiologically stable \\[not receiving radiation\\] and must not have been receiving steroids for 4 weeks prior to entry.\n\nPatients without known CNS metastases who are symptomatic for CNS metastasis must be evaluated with a CT scan or MRI scan prior to E7070 treatment.),\n\n* Patients must not have had major surgery without full recovery within 4 weeks of E7070 treatment start,\n* Patients must not have pulmonary lymphatic involvement that results in pulmonary dysfunction requiring active treatment, including the use of oxygen,\n* Patients must not have leptomeningeal metastasis,\n* Patients must not have evidence of clinically relevant ascites or pleural effusion requiring more than one isolated paracentesis or pleurocentesis per month prior to study start,\n* Patients must not be expected to require more than one isolated paracentesis or pleurocentesis per month during the study for the treatment of clinically relevant ascites or pleural effusion,\n* Patients must not be pregnant or breast-feeding and must practice adequate contraception if not surgically sterile,\n* Patients must not have severe medically uncontrolled intercurrent illness/infection,\n* Patients must not have had unstable angina or myocardial infarction in the past 6 months,\n* Patients must not have serious cardiac arrhythmia or symptomatic congestive heart failure \\>= Grade II (NYHA classification),\n* Patients must not have a history of prolonged QT, QTc \\> 470 ms (Bazett's correction) at entry, or history of torsade de pointes,\n* Patients must not have recent history (\\<= 12 months) of active or chronic viral hepatitis,\n* Patients must not have organ allografts,\n* Patients must not have known history of HIV positivity,\n* Patients must not have a history of hypersensitivity to sulfonamides,\n* Patients must not have a history of uncontrolled seizures,\n* Patients must not have had a prior malignancy, other than carcinoma in situ of the cervix or nonmelanoma skin cancer, unless the prior malignancy was diagnosed and definitively treated \\>= 5 years previously with no subsequent evidence of recurrence, or\n* Patients must not have other significant disease or disorders that, in the Investigator's opinion, would exclude the patient from the study.",
