    "eligibilityCriteria": "Inclusion Criteria:\n\n1. Written informed consent for all study procedures according to local regulatory requirements prior to beginning specific protocol procedures.\n2. Histologically confirmed unilateral or bilateral primary carcinoma of the breast.\n3. Age at diagnosis at least 18 years, female, and biologically not older than 65 years (but in any case not older than 70 years).\n4. In case of adjuvant therapy: Adequate surgical treatment with histological complete resection (R0) of the invasive breast tumor. Choice of axilla surgery is up to the participating site.\n5. Centrally confirmed ER/PgR/HER2 and Ki-67 status detected on surgical removed tissue (for adjuvant patients) or from core biopsy (for neoadjuvant patients). ER/PR positive is defined as \u2265 1% stained cells and HER2 positive is defined as IHC 3+ in \\> 10% immunoreactive cells or FISH (or equivalent test) ratio \u2265 2.0. Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) breast tissue has to be sent to the Institute of Pathology at the Charit\u00e9 Berlin prior to randomization.\n6. High risk breast cancer as defined as:\n\n   * HER2 positive or triple-negative tumors irrespective of nodal status or\n   * Luminal B-like tumors (ER and/or PgR positive, HER2 negative, Ki-67 \\> 20%) with involved lymph nodes or\n   * 4 or more involved lymph nodes.\n7. Complete staging work-up within 3 months prior to randomization. All patients must have performed bilateral mammography, breast ultrasound, breast MRT (optional), chest X-ray (PA and lateral), abdominal ultrasound or CT scan or MRT and bone scan. In case of positive bone scan, bone X-ray (or CT or MRT) is mandatory. Other tests may be performed as clinically indicated.\n8. Karnofsky Performance status index \u2265 80%.\n9. Estimated life expectancy of at least 10 years irrespective of the diagnosis of breast cancer.\n10. Confirmed normal cardiac function by ECG and cardiac ultrasound (LVEF or shortening fraction) within 2 weeks prior to randomization. LVEF must be above 55%.\n11. Laboratory requirements:\n\n    Hematology\n    * Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) \u2265 2.0 x 109/L and\n    * Platelets \u2265 100 x 109/L and\n    * Hemoglobin \u2265 10 g/dL (\u2265 6.2 mmol/L). Hepatic function\n    * Total bilirubin \u2264 1.5x above upper normal limits (UNL) and\n    * ASAT (SGOT) and ALAT (SGPT) \u2264 1.5x UNL and\n    * Alkaline phosphatase \u2264 2.5x UNL. Renal function Creatinine \u2264 1.25 UNL,\n    * Creatinine Clearance \\> 30mL/min (if creatinine is above UNL, according to Cockroft-Gault).\n12. Negative pregnancy test (urine or serum) within 14 days prior to randomization for all women of childbearing potential.\n13. Complete baseline documentation must be submitted via MedCODES and approved by GBG Forschungs GmbH.\n14. Patients must be available and compliant for central diagnostics, treatment and follow-up.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n1. Patients with Luminal A-like tumors (ER and or PgR positive, HER2 negative and Ki-67 \u2264 20%) and\n\n   * if neoadjuvant: \\< cN2 or \\< pN2(sn).\n   * if adjuvant: \\< 4 involved lymph nodes.\n2. Non-operable breast cancer.\n3. In case of adjuvant therapy: time since axillary dissection or SLNB \\> 3 months (optimal \\< 1 month).\n4. Previous and already (neoadjuvant or adjuvant) treated invasive breast carcinoma.\n5. Previous malignant disease being disease-free for less than 5 years (except CIS of the cervix and non-melanomatous skin cancer).\n6. Known or suspected congestive heart failure (\\> NYHA I) and/or coronary heart disease, angina pectoris requiring anti-anginal medication, previous history of myocardial infarction, evidence of transmural infarction on ECG, uncontrolled or poorly controlled arterial hypertension (i.e. BP \\> 160/90mm Hg under treatment with two antihypertensive drugs), rhythm abnormalities requiring permanent treatment, clinically significant valvular heart disease.\n7. Evidence for infection including wound infections, HIV, hepatitis.\n8. History of significant neurological or psychiatric disorders including psychotic disorders, dementia or seizures that would prohibit the understanding and giving of informed consent.\n9. Pre-existing motor or sensory neuropathy of a severity \u2265 grade 1 by NCI-CTCAE version 4.0.\n10. Other severe and relevant co-morbidity that would interact with the application of cytotoxic agents or the participation in the study.\n11. Previous or concurrent treatment with:\n\n    * concurrent chronic corticosteroids unless initiated \\> 6 months prior to study entry and at low dose (\u2264 10mg methylprednisolone or equivalent) except inhalative corticoids.\n    * concurrent sex hormones. Prior treatment must be stopped before study entry.\n    * concurrent treatment with any investigational, not marketed drug within 30 days prior to study entry.\n    * previous or concurrent anti-cancer therapy for any reason.\n12. Absolute contraindications for the use of corticosteroids.\n13. Pregnant or lactating patients. Patients of childbearing potential must implement adequate non-hormonal contraceptive measures (barrier methods, intrauterine contraceptive devices, sterilization) during study treatment.\n14. Known hypersensitivity reaction to one of the compounds or incorporated substances used in this protocol.",
