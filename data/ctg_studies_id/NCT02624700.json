Note: Postmenopausal is defined as one or more of the following:\n* Age \u2265 60 years\n* Age \\< 60 years and amenorrheic for at least 1 year with follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and plasma estradiol levels in the postmenopausal range\n* Bilateral oophorectomy\n* A woman of child-bearing potential (WCBP) and a male patient with partner who is a WCBP must agree to use a medically accepted method for preventing pregnancy for the duration of study treatment and for 2 months following completion of study treatment.\n* Ability to understand and willingness to sign the consent form written in English\n\nExclusion Criteria\n\n* Any investigational agent within 4 weeks prior to initiating study treatment\n* Anticancer therapy within 2 weeks prior to initiating study treatment\n* Plans for concurrent anticancer therapy except as permitted in Section 6.7.11\n* Known or presumed intolerance of pemetrexed or sorafenib\n* Known or suspected malabsorption condition or obstruction\n* Brain metastases meeting either of the following exclusion criteria:\n* Untreated brain metastases\n* After completion of brain-directed therapy, the patient has not been able to tolerate discontinuation of steroids or a decrease in steroid dose\n* Leptomeningeal metastasis\n* Any documented history of clinically identifiable thrombotic, embolic, venous, or arterial events such as cerebrovascular accident, transient ischemic attack, deep vein thrombosis, or pulmonary embolism within 6 months prior to initiating study treatment (Note: Patients with an asymptomatic catheter-related thrombus or a tumor-associated thrombus of locally-involved vessels or with incidental asymptomatic filling defects identified on imaging are not excluded.)\n* Contraindication to antiangiogenic agents, including:\n* Serious non-healing wound, non-healing ulcer, or bone fracture\n* Major surgical procedure or significant traumatic injury within 4 weeks prior to initiating study treatment\n* Pulmonary hemorrhage/bleeding event \u2265 grade 2 (CTCAE v4.0) within 12 weeks prior to initiating study treatment\n* Any other hemorrhage/bleeding event \u2265 grade 3 (CTCAE v4.0) within 12 weeks prior to initiating study treatment\n* Systolic blood pressure (BP) \\> 160 mmHg or diastolic BP \\> 100 mmHg despite optimal medical management\n* QT interval, corrected (QTc) \\> 480 ms (\u2265 grade 2) on a 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG)\n* If baseline QTc on screening ECG is \u2265 grade 2:\n* Check potassium and magnesium serum levels\n* Correct any identified hypokalemia and/or hypomagnesemia and repeat ECG to confirm exclusion of patient due to QTc\n* For patients with heart rate \\< 60 bpm or \\> 100 bpm, manual read of the QT interval by a cardiologist is required, with Fridericia correction applied to determine QT interval with correction using Fridericia's formula (QTcF) which must be used to determine eligibility (Note: If heart rate is 60-100 bpm, manual read of the QT interval and correction to QTcF is not required).\n* Active or clinically significant cardiac disease including any of the following:\n* Unstable angina (eg, anginal symptoms at rest) or onset of angina within 3 months prior to initiating study treatment\n* Myocardial infarction within 6 months prior to initiating study treatment\n* Ventricular arrhythmias requiring anti-arrhythmic therapy other than beta blockers\n* New York Heart Association (NYHA) class III or IV congestive heart failure\n* Serious (ie, \u2265 grade 3) uncontrolled infection\n* Uncontrolled effusion\n* Known human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) seropositivity (Note: HIV testing is not required)\n* Chronic or active hepatitis B or C infection requiring treatment with antiviral therapy\n* Seizure disorder requiring enzyme-inducing anti-epileptic drugs (EIAEDs) (Note: If the seizure disorder can be managed with agents that are not EIAEDs (eg, levetiracetam or valproate), the patient should not be excluded).\n* Planned ongoing treatment with other drugs thought to potentially have adverse interactions with either of the study drugs; if such drugs have been used, patients must have discontinued these agents at least 2 weeks (or as noted below) prior to initiating study treatment.
