For patients with known Gilbert's syndrome, total bilirubin levels less or equal than 2 x ULN range (with direct bilirubin less than ULN) will be accepted.\n\n   9. Highly effective contraception (i.e. methods with a failure rate of less than 1 % per year) for both male and female subjects if the risk of conception exists (Note: The effects of the trial treatment on the developing human fetus are unknown; thus, women of childbearing potential and men must agree to use highly effective contraception, defined in Appendix A or as stipulated in national or local guidelines. Highly effective contraception must be used 28 days prior to first trial treatment administration, for the duration of trial treatment, and at least for 60 days after stopping trial treatment.

Ability to understand and willingness to sign a written informed consent.\n\nInclusion Criteria Stratum A (Adjuvant patients)\n\n1. Non-metastatic, histologically confirmed primary invasive breast carcinoma\n2. Triple negative breast cancer: hormone receptor negative (ER \\< 10% and PgR \\< 10%) and HER2 negative (IHC 0/1+ or ISH non-amplified), as defined by the local pathology laboratory. In case of discordance between pre-operative core-biopsy and the surgical sample, the receptor assessment performed on the surgical sample has to be considered for inclusion criteria evaluation.\n3.

Triple negative breast cancer: hormone receptor negative (ER \\< 10% and PgR \\< 10%) and HER2 negative (IHC 0/1+ or ISH non-amplified), as defined by the local pathology laboratory. In case of discordance between the pre-treatment diagnostic core-biopsy and the surgical sample, the receptor assessment performed on the surgical sample has to be considered for inclusion criteria evaluation.\n3. Adequately excised: patients should have undergone adequate tumor excision after preoperative chemotherapy, which means surgical removal of all clinically evident disease in the breast and lymph nodes.\n\n   1. Breast surgery: patients must have undergone either breast-conserving surgery or mastectomy/nipple- or skin-sparing mastectomy. The margins of the resected specimen should be free of invasive tumor and ductal carcinoma in situ (no ink on tumor). In the case of breast-conserving surgery patients with margins positive for lobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS) are eligible without additional resection. For patients who undergo mastectomy, patients with a microscopic positive deep margin are eligible, provided they will receive radiotherapy on chest wall.\n   2. Lymph node surgery:\n\n   i. Axillary dissection without sentinel node evaluation is permitted after preoperative therapy.\n\n   ii. In case of positive results from a fine-needle aspiration, core biopsy, or sentinel node biopsy performed prior to preoperative therapy, additional surgical evaluation of the axilla following preoperative therapy is required.\n\n   iii. If sentinel node biopsy performed before preoperative therapy was negative, no additional surgical evaluation of the axilla is required after preoperative therapy.\n\n   iv. Sentinel node after preoperative therapy is allowed if no evidence of axillary node involvement was documented by ultrasonography at diagnosis. If sentinel node biopsy after preoperative therapy is negative, no further additional surgical evaluation of the axilla is required. If sentinel node biopsy performed after preoperative therapy is positive, additional surgical evaluation of the axilla is recommended.\n4.

In case of positive margins after the first intervention requiring additional resection.\n7. Availability of a formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded block containing tumor tissue or at least 7 unstained tumor slides (tumor sample from the diagnostic core-biopsy obtained before neoadjuvant chemotherapy). In case only 7 unstained slides from the bioptic sample will be available, the investigator must ensure that the sample contains tumor tissue by performing an hematoxylin and eosin staining.\n\nExclusion criteria: Stratum A (Adjuvant patients) \\& B (Post-neoadjuvant patients)\n\n1.
