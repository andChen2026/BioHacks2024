    "eligibilityCriteria": "Inclusion Criteria:\n\n1. Female patients with a histological diagnosis of locally advanced or metastatic estrogen-receptor positive, HER2 negative breast cancer\n2. Written informed consent prior to admission in the study.\n3. Target lesion diameter of \u226515mm that has not been previously irradiated and is located outside the liver\n4. Female patients aged \u2265 18 years of age\n5. For all patients: histologically confirmed locally advanced/ metastatic breast cancer with a previous biopsy confirming hormone receptor and HER2 status\n6. ECOG performance status 0-2\n7.

Life expectancy \\> 3months\n9. Adequate organ function as judged by investigator to include:\n\n   * Hb\u2265 10g/L\n   * Creatinine clearance \u226545ml/min\n10. Patients must have been appropriately staged (which may include contrast enhanced CT/ FDG-PET/ MRI) within 42 days of study entry and additional imaging according to local standard of care\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n1. Pregnant or lactating women\n2. Evidence of significant medical condition or laboratory finding which, in the opinion of the Investigator, makes it undesirable for the patient to participate in the trial\n3.

Prior use within 14 days of enrolment or concurrent therapy with any other investigational agent\n5. Patients classified as radiation workers\n6.
