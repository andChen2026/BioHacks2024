    "eligibilityCriteria": "Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Have a Stage IV diagnosis of 1 of the following: Part A: NSCLC (Kirsten rat sarcoma mutant \\[KRAS mt\\], PD-L1+); Part B: NSCLC (squamous histology); Part C: metastatic breast cancer (HR+, HER2-); or Part D: locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer (HR+, HER2-)\n\n  * Part A: must be chemotherapy na\u00efve for metastatic NSCLC\n  * Part B: must have received at least 1 prior therapy containing platinum-based chemotherapy for advanced/metastatic NSCLC\n  * Part C: must have previously received prior treatment with at least 1 but no more than 2 chemotherapy regimens in the metastatic setting\n  * Part D: cannot have received endocrine therapy or chemotherapy as treatment in the locoregionally recurrent or metastatic breast cancer disease setting. Note: Participants may be enrolled if they received prior (neo)adjuvant chemotherapy or endocrine therapy for localized disease.\n* Are amenable to provide tumor tissue prior to treatment and provide tumor tissue after treatment initiation (both mandatory).\n* Have presence of measurable disease as defined by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST 1.1).\n* Have a performance status (PS) \u22641 on the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) scale.\n* Have discontinued all previous treatments for cancer and recovered from the acute effects of therapy.\n* Have an estimated life expectancy of \u226512 weeks.\n* For Part D: Have postmenopausal status due to surgical/natural menopause or chemical ovarian suppression (initiated 28 days prior to Day 1 of Cycle 1) with a gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist such as goserelin or radiation-induced ovarian suppression.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Have a personal history of any of the following conditions: syncope of either unexplained or cardiovascular etiology, ventricular arrhythmia (including but not limited to ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation), or sudden cardiac arrest. Exception: subjects with controlled atrial fibrillation for \\>30 days prior to study treatment are eligible.\n* Have central nervous system (CNS) metastasis with development of associated neurological changes 14 days prior to receiving study drug.\n* Have corrected QT interval of \\>470 milliseconds on screening electrocardiogram (ECG).\n* Have history of interstitial lung disease or pneumonitis.\n* Have history of or active autoimmune disease, or other syndrome that requires systemic steroids or autoimmune agents for the past 2 years.\n* Have received a live vaccination within 30 days of study start.\n* Have received prior treatment with an anti PD-1, anti-programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1), or anti cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (CTLA-4) agent.\n* For Part D Only:\n\n  * Have initiated bisphosphonates or approved RANK ligand (RANK-L) targeted agents (for example, denosumab) \\<7 days prior to Cycle 1 Day 1.\n  * Are currently receiving or have previously received endocrine therapy for locoregionally recurrent or metastatic breast cancer. Note: A participant may be enrolled if she received prior (neo)adjuvant endocrine therapy (including, but not limited to anti-estrogens or aromatase inhibitors) for localized disease.\n  * Are currently receiving or have previously received chemotherapy for locoregionally recurrent or metastatic breast cancer.
