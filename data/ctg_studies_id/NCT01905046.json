the qualifying RPFNA (of one or both breasts) must be send to Dr. Seewaldt's laboratory for cytological scoring and proteomic analysis; score results must be received from Dr. Seewaldt's lab prior to patient registration/randomization; test must be done =\\< 90 days prior to registration/randomization\n\n  \\* Note: Only the contralateral breast can be aspirated in women with DCIS and those undergoing surgery for an atypical lesion;
