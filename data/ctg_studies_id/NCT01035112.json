    "eligibilityCriteria": "INCLUSION CRITERIA\n\n* Female\n* Documented breast physical examination,\n* Documented mammography within 3 months of the MR studies\n* Palpable or mammographically-detected suspect breast lesions\n* Women who have already undergone lumpectomy for breast cancer and have post-biopsy/post-radiation changes will be eligible if they have mammographically-detected or palpable breast abnormalities which are sufficiently suspicious to merit core needle or surgical biopsy.\n\nEXCLUSION CRITERIA:\n\n* Male by birth\n* Able to complete the MR examination. Subjects will be interviewed by one of the investigators for the usual contraindications to\n* MR contraindications including\n* Pacemakers\n* Metallic implants\n* Severe claustrophobia\n* Aneurysm clips\n* Pregnancy\n* Current lactation\n* Other conditions precluding proximity to a strong magnetic field.\n* Received an enhanced MR procedure within 48 hours,\n* Iodinated contrast within six hours,\n* Known sensitivity to MR contrast agents,\n* Not likely to complete the study in full or\n* Other clinical reason which would preclude participation in the protocol.",
