Male/female participants who are at least 21 years of age on the day of signing informed consent, with histologically or cytologically confirmed diagnosis of metastatic or locally advanced carcinoma of the breast not amenable to treatment with curative intent, will be enrolled in this study.\n2. Disease progression after treatment with at least 1 line of palliative endocrine therapy in the metastatic setting.\n\n   1. There is no limit to the number of lines of prior palliative endocrine therapy.\n   2. Prior targeted therapy in the locally advanced (recurrent or progressed) or metastatic setting, such as CDK4/6 inhibitors, mTOR inhibitors, PI3K inhibitors, is allowed with no limit to the number of lines of targeted therapy (prior lenvatinib is not allowed).\n   3. Maximum of 1 line of palliative chemotherapy is allowed.\n\n      * A chemotherapy line in advanced disease is an anticancer regimen(s) that contains at least 1 cytotoxic chemotherapy agent and was discontinued due to progression. If a cytotoxic chemotherapy regimen was discontinued for a reason other than disease progression then this regimen does not count as a \"prior line of chemotherapy\".\n      * Antibody-drug conjugate will be considered as cytotoxic chemotherapy in the assessment of the lines of treatment.\n3. ER positive and/or PgR positive breast cancer (based on most recent tumor biopsy or archived tumor specimen) according to American Society of Clinical Oncology/College of American Pathologists (ASCO/CAP) guidelines, assessed locally and defined as at least 1% of tumor cells stained positive.\n4. HER2-negative tumor assessed locally and defined as meeting one of the following sets of criteria:\n\n   * HER2 IHC score of 0 or 1+\n   * HER2 IHC score of 2+ accompanied by a negative fluorescence, chromogenic, or silver in situ hybridization test indicating the absence of HER2 gene amplification\n   * HER2/CEP17 ratio of \\< 2.0 based on the most recent tumor biopsy (or archived tumor sample).\n5.

A female participant is eligible to participate if she is not pregnant, not breastfeeding, and at least one of the following conditions applies:\n\n   a. Not a woman of childbearing potential (WOCBP) as defined in protocol OR b.

Patient must be willing to undergo a new tumor biopsy at screening. Bone metastases are not acceptable.\n    * A representative tumor sample obtained after progression on the patients most recent endocrine therapy must be submitted\n    * In the event that a post-progression sample is not available and a new biopsy cannot be obtained, enrolment may be considered after documented discussion with the Principal Investigator and the study team for a waiver.\n11. Have an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 to 1. Evaluation of ECOG is to be performed within 7 days prior to the first dose of study intervention.\n12. Life expectancy of more than 12 weeks.\n13.
