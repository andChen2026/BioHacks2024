Any of the following cardiac criteria:\n\n   * Mean resting QT interval corrected by Fridericia's formula (QTcF) \\>470 msec obtained from 3 consecutive ECGs\n   * History of QT prolongation associated with other medications that required discontinuation of that medication. - Any clinically important abnormalities in rhythm, conduction or morphology of resting ECG (e.g., complete left bundle branch block, third degree heart block)\n   * Medical history significant for arrhythmia (e.g., multifocal premature ventricular contractions, bigeminy, trigeminy, ventricular tachycardia), which is symptomatic or requires treatment (CTCAE Grade 3), symptomatic or uncontrolled atrial fibrillation despite treatment, or asymptomatic sustained ventricular tachycardia. Participants with atrial fibrillation controlled by medication or arrhythmias controlled by pacemakers may be permitted to enter the study based on the Investigator judgement with cardiologist consultation recommended.\n   * Any factors that increase the risk of corrected QT interval (QTc) prolongation or risk of arrhythmic events such as heart failure, hypokalaemia, potential for Torsades de pointes, congenital long QT syndrome, family history of long QT syndrome or unexplained sudden death under 40 years of age or any concomitant medication known to prolong the QT interval\n   * Experience of any of the following procedures or conditions in the preceding 6 months: coronary artery bypass graft, angioplasty, myocardial infarction, unstable angina pectoris,\n   * Congestive heart failure New York Heart Association (NYHA) grade \u22652\n9. Clinically significant abnormalities of glucose metabolism defined as HbA1c \u22658.0% (63.9 mmol/mol) at screening\n10.
