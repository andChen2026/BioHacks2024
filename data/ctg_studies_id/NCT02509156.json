    "eligibilityCriteria": "Inclusion Criteria\n\nTo participate, a subject MUST:\n\n1. Be \u2265 18 and \\< 80 years of age\n2. Be a cancer survivor with diagnosis of AIC\n3. Have an LVEF \u2264 45% by cMRI\n4. Be in NYHA class II-III\n5. Have received the initial diagnosis of AIC at least six months earlier and be on stable, optimally-tolerated therapy with beta-blockers, ACE inhibitors/ARBs, and/or aldosterone antagonists for 3 months, unless contraindicated\n6. Have a period of at least two years of clinical cancer-free state\\* and low likelihood of recurrence (a five-year risk of recurrence estimated at 30% or less), as determined by an oncologist, based on tumor type, response to therapy, and negative metastatic work-up at the time of diagnosis (\\*exceptions to this are carcinoma in situ or fully resected basal and squamous cell cancer of the skin.)\n7. Be a candidate for cardiac catheterization\n\nExclusion Criteria\n\nTo participate, a subject MUST NOT HAVE:\n\n1. A life expectancy \\<12 months\n2. A CT scan or baseline cardiac MRI showing new tumor or suspicious lymphadenopathy raising concern of malignancy\n3. Presence of obstructive CAD as determined via imaging within 5 years prior to study enrollment provided there have been no symptoms or evidence of CAD since the test\n4. Had a previous myocardial infarction\n5. A history of radiation therapy AND evidence of constrictive physiology and/or evidence of other patterns of non-ischemic cardiomyopathy on cardiac MRI (e.g., amyloidosis, sarcoidosis, hemochromatosis, pure radiation-induced cardiomyopathy, etc.) not consistent with AIC being the dominant etiology of heart failure\n6. Valvular heart disease including 1) mechanical or bioprosthetic heart valve; or 2) severe valvular (any valve) insufficiency/regurgitation within 12 months of consent.\n7. Aortic stenosis with valve area \u2264 1.5cm2\n8. A history of LV reduction surgery or cardiomyoplasty\n9. Evidence of cardiogenic shock\n10. A history of ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke within 90 days of baseline testing\n11. Liver dysfunction during baseline testing, as evidenced by enzymes (e.g., AST, ALT, alkaline phosphatase) greater than 3 times upper limit of normal\n12. Diabetes with poorly controlled blood glucose levels (HbA1c \\> 8.5%)\n13. An underlying autoimmune disorder or current immunosuppressive therapy (e.g., chronic corticosteroid, rheumatologic or immune modulating therapy) or likelihood of use of immunosuppressive therapy during participation in the trial (medications will be considered on a case by case basis)\n14. A baseline eGFR \\<35 ml/min/1.73m2\n15. A contrast allergy that cannot adequately be managed by premedication\n16. Received gene or cell-based therapy from any source within the previous 12 months\n17. A hematologic abnormality during baseline testing as evidenced by hemoglobin \\< 9 g/dl; hematocrit \\< 30%; absolute neutrophil count \\< 2,000 or total WBC count more than 2 times upper limit of normal; or platelet values \\< 100,000/ul\n18. Evidence of active systemic infection at time of study product delivery\n19. HIV and/or active HBV or HCV\n20. Coagulopathy (INR \\> 1.5) not due to a reversible cause (e.g., warfarin and/or Factor Xa inhibitors) (see Section 6.4 re: injection procedure and anticoagulation therapy) Note: Subjects who cannot be withdrawn from anticoagulation will be excluded.\n21. Presence of LV thrombus\n22. Presence of a pacemaker and/or ICD generator with any of the following limitations/conditions:\n\n    * manufactured before the year 2000\n    * leads implanted \\< 6 weeks prior to consent\n    * non-transvenous epicardial or abandoned leads\n    * subcutaneous ICDs\n    * leadless pacemakers\n    * any other condition that, in the judgment of device-trained staff, would deem an MRI contraindicated\n23. Pacemaker-dependence with an ICD (Note: pacemaker-dependent candidates without an ICD are not excluded)\n24. A cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) device implanted \\< 3 months prior to consent\n25. Other MRI contraindications (e.g. patient body habitus incompatible with MRI)\n26. An appropriate ICD firing or anti-tachycardia pacing (ATP) for ventricular fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia within 30 days of consent\n27. Ventricular tachycardia \u2265 20 consecutive beats without an ICD within 3 months of consent, or symptomatic Mobitz II or higher degree atrioventricular block without a functioning pacemaker within 3 months of consent\n28. A history of drug abuse (use of illegal \"street\" drugs except marijuana, or prescription medications not being used appropriately for a pre-existing medical condition) or alcohol abuse (\u2265 5 drinks/day for \u02c3 3 months), or documented medical, occupational, or legal problems arising from the use of alcohol or drugs within the past 24 months\n29. Cognitive or language barriers that prohibit obtaining informed consent or any study elements (interpreter permitted)\n30. Participation (currently or within the previous 30 days) in a cardiac related investigational therapeutic (including stem cell based therapies) or device trial\n31. Pregnancy, lactation, plans to become pregnant in the next 12 months, or is unwilling to use acceptable forms of birth control during study participation\n32. Any other condition that, in the judgment of the Investigator or Sponsor, would be a contraindication to enrollment, study product administration, or follow-up",
