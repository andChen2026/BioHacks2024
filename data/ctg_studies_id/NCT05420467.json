    "eligibilityCriteria": "Inclusion Criteria:\n\n1. Female patients aged \u226518 years;\n2. Histopathologically or cytologically confirmed breast cancer patients with the following characteristics:1. stage I to III breast cancer; 2. operable primary lesion with no evidence of distant metastasis (M0);\n3. known hormone receptor status (estrogen receptor \\[ER\\], progesterone receptor \\[PR\\]) and HER2 status with known Ki67 expression levels; (ER/PR positive defined as stained cells \\>1%, HER2 positive defined as IHC 3+ or IHC 2+ with a positive FISH test);\n4. Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC): ER/PR negative, HER2 negative; tumor \\>2cm or lymph node metastasis with clear postoperative pathological evidence; Luminal breast cancer: ER\\>1%, HER2 negative, postoperative pathological evidence definite lymph node metastasis (different adjuvant chemotherapy regimens depending on whether the lymph nodes are N1 or N2-3); HER2-positive breast cancer: HER2-positive, regardless of ER/PR status; (the above classification determines enrollment and adjuvant therapy, and does not represent the corresponding molecular typing definition);\n5. Patients who have undergone breast cancer resection and systemic intrathoracic lymph node dissection; surgical resection is R0 resection; patients who need postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy as judged by the investigator;\n6. Start of adjuvant therapy within 21 days of the time of surgery is appropriate ;\n7. ECOG physical fitness score of 0-1 with an expected survival of \\>6 months ;\n8. Patients have not been treated with a paclitaxel regimen prior to enrolment ;\n9. Adjuvant chemotherapy should not be performed concurrently with endocrine therapy drugs such as tamoxifen/aromatase inhibitors or postoperative radiotherapy;\n10. Women of childbearing age must have taken reliable contraceptive measures, or performed a pregnancy test (serum or urine) within 7 days before enrollment, with a negative result, and be willing to use appropriate contraceptives during the trial and 8 weeks after the last dose of the trial drug;\n11. Electrocardiogram (ECG) and echocardiography must confirm normal cardiac function within 3 months prior to randomization. Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) must be \u226555% for patients receiving anthracycline-containing chemotherapy regimens and targeted therapy ;\n12. Liver and kidney function: serum creatinine \u22641.5 times the upper limit of normal; AST and ALT \u22643 times the upper limit of normal; total bilirubin \u22641.5 times the upper limit of normal, or \u22642.5 times the upper limit of normal when the patient has Gilbert's syndrome ;\n13. Bone marrow function: neutrophils\u22651.5\u00d7109/L, platelets\u2265100\u00d7109/L, hemoglobin\u226590g/L;\n14. Able to comply with outpatient treatment, laboratory monitoring and necessary clinical visits during the study period;\n15. Subjects have the ability to understand, agree and sign the Informed Consent Form (ICF) for the study prior to initiating any protocol-related procedures; subjects have the ability to express consent (if applicable).\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n1. Advanced and/or inoperable patients with distant metastasis confirmed by imaging evidence or pathology;\n2. Other malignant tumors have occurred in the past 5 years, except for skin cancers of cured cervical carcinoma in situ and non-melanoma;\n3. Pregnant or breastfeeding women; patients with childbearing potential who are unwilling or unable to take effective contraceptive measures;\n4. The molecular status of ER/PR and HER2 and Ki67 cannot be determined;\n5. Patients with CNS metastases or \\> grade 1 peripheral neuropathy;\n6. Severe cardiovascular disease: Grade II or higher myocardial ischaemia or myocardial infarction, poorly controlled arrhythmias (including QTc interval \u2265 470 ms); Grade III-IV cardiac insufficiency according to NYHA criteria, or cardiac ultrasound indicating a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of \\<50%;\n7. Patients with hypertension that cannot be reduced to the normal range after antihypertensive medication (systolic blood pressure\\>140 mmHg, diastolic blood pressure\\>90 mmHg);\n8. Received major surgical operations or suffered severe traumatic injury, fracture or ulcer within 4 weeks of enrollment;\n9. Patients with severe myelosuppression at screening;\n10. Patients with severe liver dysfunction (Child's Class III) or renal dysfunction at screening ;\n11. Arterial/venous thrombotic events such as cardiovascular and cerebrovascular accidents (including transient ischemic attack, cerebral hemorrhage, cerebral infarction, myocardial infarction), deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism, that occurred within 6 months before randomization;\n12. Patients with hypersensitivity to any of the components of albumin paclitaxel, epirubicin, cyclophosphamide, docetaxel, trastuzumab, and pertuzumab;\n13. Patients with psychiatric disorders;\n14. Subjects who are participating in another clinical study or whose first dose was administered less than 4 weeks (or 5 half-lives of the study drug) from the end of the previous clinical study (last dose) ;\n15. The investigator judges other situations that may affect the clinical research and the judgment of the research results and are not suitable for inclusion in the research.",
