Tumor extent for the indication:\n\n   * regression must be achieved for radical surgical removal or\n   * regression is required for breast-conserving surgery or\n   * if hormone receptor (HR)-positive and Her2-: stage IIB (cT2N1 or cT3NO) - IIIC,\n   * if HR-negative: stage IIA (cT2N0 or cT0-1N1) - IIIC Note: In the case of a locally advanced, irresectable case, if the possibility of radical surgery later is a realistic goal, the participant may be included in the study.\n4. Appropriate general condition: ECOG 0-1\n5. Proper organ function\n\n   * Neutrophil count \u2265 1.5 G / l, platelet count \u2265 100 G / l, hemoglobin \u2265 10 g / dl\n   * Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) / aspartate aminotransferase (AST) is less than 1.5 times the upper limit of the normal range\n   * bilirubin less than 1.5 times the upper limit of the normal range (except Gilbert's disease, where less than 3 times)\n   * creatinine less than 1.5 times the upper limit of the normal range or estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) higher than 60 ml / min\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n1. Proven or suspected distant metastasis.\n2. No staging studies have been performed: at least chest x-ray, abdominal ultrasound.
