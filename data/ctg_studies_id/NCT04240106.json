The following will not be counted as a prior line of cytotoxic chemotherapy:\n\n  * Prior hormonal therapy and non-hormonal targeted therapy.\n  * Targeted and biologic therapies.\n  * The patient can receive a stable dose of bisphosphonates or denosumab for bone metastases, before and during the study as long as this was started at least 5 days prior to study treatment.\n* 16. Prior carboplatin- or other platinum compound-based therapy is allowed if have been administered in one of the following settings:\n\n  * Disease-free interval \\> 12 months from date of completion of neoadjuvant or adjuvant treatment.\n  * As potentially curative treatment for a prior non-breast cancer with no evidence of disease for \u2265 5 years.\n* 17.

Willingness and ability to provide the most recent tumor biopsy since last progression from either metastatic or primary tissues both at the time of the inclusion and at disease progression or study termination in order to perform exploratory studies. If not feasible, patient eligibility should be evaluated by a Sponsor's qualified designee.\n* 19. Patients must agree to provide blood samples at the time of study inclusion, every three cycles of treatment, and upon disease progression or study termination in order to perform exploratory studies.\n* 20. Adequate hematologic and organ function within 28 days before the first study treatment on Cycle 1 Day 1.\n* 21. Female patients of childbearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test within 3 days prior to study treatment and must agree to abstain from activities that could result in pregnancy from screening through 6 months after the last dose of study treatment, or patients of non-childbearing potential, where nonchildbearing potential is defined as follows (by other than medical reasons):\n\n  * \u226545 years of age and has not had menses for \\>1 year;\n  * Patients who have been amenorrhoeic for \\<2 years without history of a hysterectomy and oophorectomy must have levels of Luteinizing hormone (LH) and Follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) in the post-menopausal range for women \\<50;\n  * Post-hysterectomy, post-bilateral oophorectomy, or posttubal ligation: documented hysterectomy or oophorectomy must be confirmed with medical records of the actual procedure or confirmed by an ultrasound.
