Female patients \u2265 18 years at the time of signing ICF.\n3. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status of 0 or 1.\n4. Life expectancy of \u2265 12 weeks.\n5. Histologically confirmed Triple Negative Breast Cancer (TNBC) per American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO)/College of American Pathologists (CAP) criteria based on local testing on the most recent analyzed biopsy. Triple-negative is defined as \\<1% expression for estrogen receptor (ER) and progesterone receptor (PgR) and negative for Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor 2 (HER2) (0-1+ by immunohistochemistry (IHC) or 2+ and negative by in situ hybridization \\[ISH) test\\].\n6. Unresectable locally advanced or metastatic disease documented by computerized tomography (CT) scan or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) that is not amenable to resection with curative intent.\n7. Measurable or evaluable disease as per RECIST v.1.1. Patients with only bone lesions are also eligible.\n8. Refractory to or relapsed after one or two prior standard of care chemotherapy regimens for unresectable locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer (MBC). Earlier adjuvant or neoadjuvant therapy for more limited disease will be considered as one of the required prior regimens if the development of unresectable locally advanced or metastatic disease occurred within a 12-month period of time after completion of chemotherapy.\n\n   Note: Exclusive tumor marker elevation will not be considered sufficient for diagnosis of disease progression.\n9. Prior therapy must have included a taxane in any combination or order and either in the early, locally advanced, or metastatic setting. Note: Exclusive prior taxane-based therapy as adjuvant or neoadjuvant treatment is also allowed if the patient had a disease-free interval of less than 12 months after completing this treatment.\n10. Eligible for one of the chemotherapy options (eribulin, capecitabine, carboplatin plus gemcitabine) as per local investigator assessment and slots availability. Patients treated with (neo)adjuvant platinum salts or capecitabine and who have relapsed more than one year after the last dose of either treatment may be allowed to be included in the treatment arm based on ipatasertib (GDC-0068) in combination with carboplatin plus gemcitabine and capecitabine, respectively.\n11. Previous treatment with androgen receptor antagonists, poly ADP-ribose Polymerase (PARP) inhibitors, and immunotherapy is allowed. Those patients who have previously received a PARP inhibitor will not be included in the carboplatin and gemcitabine arm unless PARP inhibitors were used in the early breast cancer setting and the period between the end of PARP inhibitor-based regimen and onset of metastatic disease is at least of 12 months.\n12. Resolution of all acute toxic effects of prior anti-cancer therapy to grade inferior or equal to 1 as determined by the NCI-CTCAE v.5.0 (except for alopecia or other toxicities not considered a safety risk for the patient at investigator's discretion).\n13. Willingness and ability to provide a tumor biopsy from a metastatic site or the primary breast tumor at the time of the inclusion in order to perform exploratory studies. If not feasible, patient eligibility should be evaluated by a Sponsor's qualified designee. Note: Subjects for whom tumor biopsies cannot be obtained (e.g., inaccessible tumor or subject safety concern) may submit an archived metastatic tumor specimen only upon agreement from the Sponsor.\n14. Patients agree to give blood samples (liquid biopsy) at the time of inclusion, after two cycles of study treatment, and upon progression or study termination.\n15.

Renal: Serum creatinine \\< 1.5 \u00d7 ULN or creatinine clearance \u2265 50 mL/min based on Cockcroft-Gault glomerular filtration rate estimation.\n    4. Coagulation: Partial Thromboplastin Time (PTT) (or activated Partial Thromboplastin Time \\[aPTT\\]) and International Normalized Ratio (INR) \u2264 1.5 \u00d7 ULN (except for patients receiving anticoagulation therapy).\n\n    Note: Patients receiving heparin treatment should have a PTT (or aPTT) \u2264 2.5 \u00d7 ULN (or patient value before starting heparin treatment). Patients receiving coumarin derivatives should have an INR between 2.0 and 3.0 assessed in two consecutive measurements one to four days apart.
