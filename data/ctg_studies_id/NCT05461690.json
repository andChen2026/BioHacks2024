Previous neoadjuvant or adjuvant treatment with platinum or/and anthracycline were allowed if at least 6 months had elapsed since the last dose. Previous treatment with platinum or/and anthracycline for metastatic disease were allowed if there was no evidence that disease progression had occurred during treatment.\n9. Patient has adequate organ function, defined as:\n\n   1.
