    "eligibilityCriteria": "Inclusion Criteria:\n\n1. Participants must meet the following criteria on screening examination to be eligible to participate in the study\n2. Pathologic documentation of invasive breast cancer by biopsy (FNA alone is not adequate).\n3. AJCC clinical stage I with T1 \\> 1.5 cm, stage II or III invasive breast cancer.\n4. Participants with multicentric or bilateral disease are eligible if at least one lesion meets stage eligibility criteria for the study and no tumor is HER2-positive.\n5. Tumors must be HER2 negative defined as HER2 0 or 1+ by immunohistochemistry (IHC) assays and /or lack of gene amplification by FISH defined as a ratio \\< 2 on invasive tumor by local review.\n6. ER and PgR status by IHC must be known. Tumor must be ER and PR negative (\u22645% staining) by local review.\n7. Known BRCA1/2 (BReast CAncer) status is not required for study entry. However patients known to have a germline deleterious BRCA1/2 mutation should be encouraged to consider a preoperative trial specifically designed for BRCA1/2 carriers, if available.\n8. Breast imaging should include imaging of the ipsilateral axilla. For subjects with a clinically positive axilla, a needle aspiration, core biopsy or SLN procedure will be performed to confirm the presence of metastatic disease in the lymph nodes.\n\nFor patients with a clinically negative axilla, baseline assessment of the axilla will be performed at the discretion of the treating investigator.\n\nFor patients with pathologically positive axillary lymph nodes prior to preoperative therapy, a level I and II lymph node dissection at the time of definitive surgery is recommended.\n\n9. Patients with a prior history of contra-lateral breast cancer are eligible if they have no evidence of recurrence of their initial primary breast cancer within the last 5 years.\n\n10. Women \u2265 18 years of age. 11. ECOG performance status \u22641 (see Appendix A). 12. Laboratory Evaluation\n\n1. Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) \u2265 1,500 / mm3\n2. Platelet count \u2265 100,000/ mm3\n3. Bilirubin \u2264 1.5x upper limit of normal (ULN), for patients with Gilbert syndrome, direct bilirubin will be measured instead of total bilirubin\n4. ALT, AST \u22643.0 x ULN ALK Phos \\<2.5 x ULN\n5. Creatinine \u2264 1.5 mg/dl or creatinine clearance \u2265 60 cc/min\n6. Hemoglobin \u2265 9 mg/dl\n7. Use of an effective means of contraception is required in subjects of childbearing potential since study agents are known to be teratogenic. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately. Women of child-bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception (barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry and for the duration of study participation.\n8. Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document\n9. Individuals with a history of other malignancies are eligible if they have been disease-free for at least 5 years and are deemed by the investigator to be at low risk for recurrence of that malignancy and did not receive prior chemotherapy. Individuals with the following cancers are eligible if diagnosed and treated within the past 5 years: cervical cancer in situ, and basal cell or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin.\n10. Patient must be willing to undergo mandatory research biopsy and blood draw. Prior to biopsy procedures patients must be able to be off medications that could increase the risk of bleeding\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n1. Participants with axillary adenopathy only are not eligible for this study.\n2. Prior chemotherapy: Prior non-taxane or platinum containing chemotherapy will be allowed if the prior exposure was at least 5 years ago and the exposure is thought not to potentially interact with the primary outcome of the trial or put the patient at undue risk, and should be reviewed with study PI on a case by case basis.\n3. Any prior treatment for the current breast cancer, including chemotherapy, hormonal therapy, radiation or experimental therapy.\n4. Ipsilateral breast recurrence, unless prior treatment consisted of excision alone for DCIS or breast conserving treatment and hormonal therapy for DCIS or invasive breast cancer.\n5. Ongoing use of any other investigational or study agents.\n6. Peripheral neuropathy of any etiology \\> grade 1 (NCI CTCAE Version 4.0- Appendix B)\n7. Significant hearing loss that would prevent cisplatin administration.\n8. Renal dysfunction for which exposure to cisplatin would be unsafe or require cisplatin dose modification (i.e., Cre \\> 1.5 mg/dl or GFR \\< 60 cc/min).",
