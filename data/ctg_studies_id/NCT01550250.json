Women with a histological diagnosis of breast cancer experiencing edema in the ipsilateral arm such that there is a minimum 10% and maximum 40% increase in arm volume over the unaffected arm (mild to moderate lymphedema).\n2. Patients must have completed all primary and adjuvant treatments (surgery, chemotherapy, radiotherapy) prior to randomization.\n3. Patients must have their own fitted compression garment for daytime maintenance.\n4. No past or current use of a night-time compression system for maintenance. Those patients who have trialed a night-time compression system in the past year must observe a six-month washout period before entering the trial.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n1. Clinical or radiological evidence of active disease, either local or metastatic.\n2. History of contralateral breast cancer and axillary surgery.\n3. Serious non-malignant disease, such as renal or cardiac failure, which would preclude daily treatment and follow-up.\n4. Patients for whom compression is contraindicated.\n5.
