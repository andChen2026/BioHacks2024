    "eligibilityCriteria": "Inclusion Criteria:\n\n1. Female patients \u226519 years old\n2. Histologically proven mTNBC\\* irrespective of PD-L1 status.\n\n   \\*Histological or cytological diagnosis of relapsed/metastatic TNBC. TNBC is defined by the negative expression of estrogen receptors (ER), progesterone receptors and human epidermal receptor-2 (HER2). If there is a pathology report of the metastasis, take the histopathology of the metastases as standard. Negative for ER and progesterone receptors is defined as the expression of ER and progesterone receptors in \\<1% of the tumor cells by immunohistochemistry (IHC). HER2-negative is defined as a score of 0 and 1+ by IHC, or IHC 2+ and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) negative. If the HER2 test result is 0 or 1+ by IHC, FISH detection is optional, but the result must be negative.\n3. Has provided archival tumor tissue sample or newly obtained core or excisional biopsy of a tumor lesion not previously irradiated. Formalin-fixed, paraffin embedded (FFPE) tissue blocks are preferred to slides.

Participants who are HBsAg positive are eligible if they have received HBV anti-viral therapy for at least 4 weeks and have undetectable HBV viral load prior to randomization.\n\n    * Note: Participants should remain on anti-viral therapy throughout study intervention and follow local guidelines for HBV anti-viral therapy post completion of study intervention.\n    * Hepatitis B screening tests are not required unless:\n\n      * Known history of HBV infection\n      * As mandated by local health authority\n11. Participants with history of HCV infection are eligible if HCV viral load is undetectable at screening.\n\n    * Note: Participants must have completed curative anti-viral therapy at least 4 weeks prior to randomization.\n    * Hepatitis C screening tests are not required unless:\n\n      * Known history of HCV infection\n      * As mandated by local health authority\n12. The patient should provide written informed consent\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n1. Is currently participating in or has participated in a study of an investigational agent or has used an investigational device within 4 weeks prior to the first dose of study treatment.\n\n   - Note: Participants who have entered the follow-up phase of an investigational study may participate as long as it has been 4 weeks after the last dose of the previous investigational agent.\n2. Has known active CNS metastases and/or carcinomatous meningitis. Participants with previously treated brain metastases may participate provided they are radiologically stable, i.e., without evidence of progression for at least 4 weeks by repeat imaging (note that the repeat imaging should be performed during study screening), clinically stable and without requirement of steroid treatment for at least 14 days prior to first dose of study treatment\n3.
