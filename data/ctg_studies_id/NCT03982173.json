Female partners of a male subject must use a highly effective method of contraception throughout this period. Not engaging in sexual activity is an acceptable practice; however, occasional abstinence, the rhythm method, and the withdrawal method are not acceptable methods of contraception. Male subjects should refrain from sperm donation and female subjects should refrain from oocyte donation throughout this period.\n13. Absence of any psychological, familial or geographical condition potentially hampering compliance with the study protocol and follow-up schedule; those conditions should be discussed with the patient before inclusion in the trial\n14. Patient must be affiliated to a social security system or beneficiary of the same\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n1. Participation in another clinical study with an investigational product during the last 4 weeks (excepting noninterventional clinical studies)\n2. Concurrent enrolment in another clinical study (with an investigational product), unless it is an non-interventional clinical study\n3.

A shorter duration of five half times may be considered after Sponsor approval, for patients treated with non-cytotoxic drugs). (If sufficient wash-out time has not occurred due to the schedule or PK properties of an agent, a longer wash-out period may be required.)\n7. Current or prior use of immunosuppressive medication within 14 days before the first dose of durvalumab or tremelimumab. The following are exceptions to this criterion:\n\n   1. Intranasal, inhaled, topical steroids, or local steroid injections (eg, intra articular injection)\n   2.

Uncontrolled intercurrent illness, including but not limited to, ongoing or active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, uncontrolled hypertension, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, interstitial lung disease, serious chronic gastrointestinal conditions associated with diarrhea, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirement, substantially increase risk of incurring AEs or compromise the ability of the patient to give written informed consent\n15.
