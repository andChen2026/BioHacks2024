Prior to study enrollment, subjects of childbearing potential must be advised of the importance of avoiding pregnancy during trial participation and the potential risk factors for an unintentional pregnancy.\n* Patients must undergo a baseline physical therapy evaluation prior to axillary lymph node dissection.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Patients with history of ipsilateral breast cancer (invasive or ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS))\n* Patients with history of prior ipsilateral axillary surgery, such as excisional biopsy of lymph nodes or treatment of benign axillary disease processes such as hidradenitis\n* Patients with history of or concurrent diagnosis of contralateral breast cancer (bilateral breast cancer)\n* Patients with planned contralateral axillary surgery or history of contralateral axillary surgery\n* Patients with history of or concurrent malignancy of the ipsilateral or contralateral upper extremity- i.e. skin cancer\n* Patients with history of lymphedema or lymphatic dysmotility of the ipsilateral or contralateral arm or are found to have lymphatic dysfunction at their pre-operative visit\n* Patients with history of upper extremity blood clot, lymphangitis/cellulitis\n* Patients with history of congestive heart failure or significant cardiac disease (such as New York Heart Association Class III or greater cardiac disease) including pacemakers incompatible for bioimpedance\n* Patients with history of allergy to ICG or Iodine/Shellfish\n* Patients with evidence of liver dysfunction including diagnosis of end stage liver disease or abnormal liver tests at pre-op workup\n* Patients with less than 10 lymph nodes removed if no neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) received, or less than 8 lymph nodes if NAC received. These node counts include nodes harvested as part of sentinel lymph node biopsy\n* There is a lack of description of intraoperative findings, anatomy, procedure: 1) Identification and preservation of axillary vein, long thoracic nerve, thoracodorsal nerve; 2) Complete Level I and Level II axillary dissection (with or without Level III and Rotter's node dissection at the treating surgeon's discretion).\n* Patients who are confirmed to be pregnant or breastfeeding.\n* History of any other disease, metabolic dysfunction, clinical examination finding, or clinical laboratory finding giving reasonable suspicion of a disease or condition that contraindicates the use of protocol therapy or that might affect the interpretation of the results of the study or that puts the subject at high risk for treatment complications, in the opinion of the treating physician.\n* Prisoners or subjects who are involuntarily incarcerated, or subjects who are compulsorily detained for treatment of either a psychiatric or physical illness.",
