Histological confirmation of recurrent/metastatic disease is not required if clinical evidence of stage IV disease recurrence is available\n* Tumors are positive for estrogen receptors (ER), progesterone receptors (PgR), or both (ie, 10% or more of infiltrating cancer cells exhibit nuclear staining for ER and/or PgR; positive biochemical test results are also acceptable)\n* The patient has received prior antiestrogen therapy:\n\n  1. With at least one antiestrogen agent (with or without ovarian suppression) administered for \u2265 3 months in the adjuvant or metastatic setting; and\n  2.

Age \u2265 18 years with an intact uterus and amenorrhea for \u2265 12 months, with estradiol and/or follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) values in the postmenopausal range\n  2.
