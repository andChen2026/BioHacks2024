    "eligibilityCriteria": "Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Pathologically confirmed invasive breast cancer.\n* Negative expression of estrogen receptor (ER) and progesterone receptor (PR) according to immunohistochemistry (i.e., tumor cells showing positive staining in less than 1% of all tumor cells).\n* Negative human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) status as determined by immunohistochemistry: HER2 score of 0/1+ or, if the score is 2+, HER2/CEP17 ratio less than 2.0 or HER2 gene copy number less than 4, as confirmed by in situ hybridization (ISH).\n* Clinical tumor staging: T1c, N1-N2 or T2, N0-N2 or T3, N0-N2 or T4a-d, N0-N2.\n* The subjects were required to have good organ function, as evidenced by the following tests conducted within 7 days before randomization:\n\nHematology examination (excluding blood transfusion or use of hematopoietic stimulating agents for correction):\n\n* Hemoglobin (Hb) \u2265 90 g/L.\n* Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) \u2265 1.5 \u00d7 109/L.\n* Absolute lymphocyte count (ALC) \u2265 0.5 \u00d7 109/L.\n* Platelet count (PLT) \u2265 100 \u00d7 109/L.\n* White blood cell count (WBC) \u2265 3.0 \u00d7 109/L and \u2264 15 \u00d7 109/L.\n\nSerum biochemistry examination (excluding recent blood transfusion or albumin administration):\n\n* Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) \u2264 1.5 times the upper limit of normal (ULN).\n* Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) \u2264 2.5 ULN.\n* Total bilirubin (TBIL) \u2264 1.5 ULN.\n* Serum creatinine (Cr) \u2264 1.5 ULN, with creatinine clearance (CrCL) \u2265 50 mL/min (calculated using the Cockcroft-Gault formula).\n* Prothrombin time (PT) and activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) \u2264 1.5 ULN, and international normalized ratio (INR) \u2264 1.5 ULN (if not receiving anticoagulant therapy).\n\n  * Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) within the normal range; if TSH is abnormal, levels of free triiodothyronine (FT3) and free thyroxine (FT4) should be examined. If FT3/FT4 results are not available, T3 and T4 measurements can be considered, and if T3/T4 levels are within the normal range, the subject can be included.\n  * Urine analysis: Urinary protein \\< 2+; if urinary protein is \u2265 2+, a 24-hour urine protein quantification should demonstrate protein \u2264 1g.\n  * Cardiac echocardiography: Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) \u2265 55%.\n  * 12-lead electrocardiogram: Fridericia-corrected QT interval (QTcF) \\< 470 msec.\n  * Women of childbearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test within 3 days prior to initiating medication, and they and their partners must agree to use highly effective methods of contraception during the study and for 180 days after the last administration of the investigational drug.\n  * Voluntary participation in the clinical trial and signing of the informed consent form are required.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Known history of allergy to the components of the investigational drug.\n* Previous receipt of antitumor treatment or radiation therapy for any malignancy (excluding previously cured cervical carcinoma in situ and basal cell carcinoma).\n* Undergone major surgery unrelated to breast cancer within the past 4 weeks, or patients who have not fully recovered from such surgery.\n* Inability to swallow, intestinal obstruction, or other factors that may affect the administration and absorption of the medication.\n* Severe cardiac disease or discomfort that prevents treatment.\n* Presence of mental illness or substance abuse that interferes with compliance.\n* Pregnant or breastfeeding women.\n* Concurrent participation in other clinical trials.\n* Subjects deemed by the investigator to have conditions that pose a serious risk to the safety of the participant or may affect the completion of the study, or individuals who are considered unsuitable for inclusion based on other reasons.",
