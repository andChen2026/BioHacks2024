    "eligibilityCriteria": "Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Women with invasive breast cancer and/or ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) who will be undergoing breast conservation surgery, consisting of a lumpectomy or partial mastectomy procedure\n* Patients must be planning and able to undergo breast conservation surgery with planned localization (any localization device is eligible) and intraoperative imaging for the management of invasive breast cancer and/or DCIS.\n* Patients must have histologically confirmed invasive breast cancer, ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), or invasive breast cancer with a DCIS component.\n* The invasive breast cancer and/or DCIS lesion must have been visualized on mammography/ digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT), ultrasound (US), or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).\n\n  * Note: Patients with mammographically occult lesions are eligible, provided the lesion can be visualized using MRI or US.\n* Patients must be women who are \\>= 18 years of age.\n\n  * NOTE: Males and children under the age of 18 are not included in this study because the treatment paradigms for these groups are aggressive and routinely include mastectomy, whereas the present study is an investigation of breast conservation.\n* The patient (or the patient's legally authorized representative if the patient has impaired decision-making capacity) must have the ability to understand and provide voluntary written informed consent to participate in this study, prior to registration.\n* Patients who have received neoadjuvant chemotherapy for the treatment of breast cancer are eligible\n* Patients with bilateral breast cancer and/or multicentric disease are eligible.\n\n  * Note: For these patients, the VSI device will only be used on a single lesion\n* Subjects with a prior or concurrent malignancy whose natural history or treatment does not have the potential to interfere with the safety or efficacy assessment of the investigational intervention for this trial are eligible.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Patients undergoing re-excision for invasive breast cancer or DCIS are not eligible\n* Patients who are expected to have an excised lumpectomy specimen that is larger than 9 cm x 9 cm x 7 cm are not eligible\n\n  * Note: The specimen size limitation for the VSI device is 9 cm x 9 cm x 7 cm (length x width x height).\n* Patients must not have a physical or psychiatric illness, condition, or social circumstance that the investigator feels would interfere with study compliance or would compromise the patient's safety or study endpoints.",
