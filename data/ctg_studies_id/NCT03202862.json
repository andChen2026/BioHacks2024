Duration of adjuvant aromatase inhibitors treatment should be at least 2 years.\n   * Progressing on at least 6 months first line aromatase inhibitors therapy for advanced disease\n5. Metastatic disease must be measurable or evaluable. Patients fulfilling one of the following criteria:\n\n   * Patients with measurable disease as per RECIST 1.1 criteria.\n   * Patients with bone lesions, lytic or mixed (lytic + sclerotic), which had not been previously irradiated, in the absence of measurable disease as defined by RECIST 1.1 criteria.\n6.

Presence of life-threatening metastatic visceral disease, defined as extensive hepatic involvement, or any degree of brain or leptomeningeal involvement (past or present), or symptomatic pulmonary lymphangitic spread. Patients with discrete pulmonary parenchymal metastases are eligible, provided their respiratory function is not compromised as a result of disease.\n2. Previous systemic chemotherapy for advanced breast cancer.\n3. Received endocrine therapy for advanced breast cancer \\> 1 lines;\n4. Extensive radiation therapy within the last 4 weeks (greater than or equal to 30% marrow or whole pelvis or spine) or cytotoxic treatment within the past 4 weeks prior to screening laboratory assessment, or strontium-90 (or other radiopharmaceuticals) within the past 3 months.\n5.

History of:\n\n    \u2022bleeding diathesis (i.e., disseminated intravascular coagulation \\[DIC\\], clotting factor deficiency), or long-term anticoagulant therapy (other than antiplatelet therapy and low dose warfarin).\n11. History of hypersensitivity to active or inactive excipients of Fulvestrant and castor oil.\n\nAny severe concomitant condition which makes it undesirable for the patient to participate in the trial or which would jeopardize compliance with the trial protocol. E.g. uncontrolled cardiac disease or uncontrolled diabetes mellitus.",
