    "eligibilityCriteria": "Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Non-small cell lung cancer with historic PD-L1 \u2265 1%, as determined locally using a clinically accepted assay. Patients must have experienced benefit from previous anti-PD(L)1-containing therapy for at least 4 months based on investigator-assessed disease stability or response prior to developing documented disease progression. Patients must have also received prior platinum-based chemotherapy, either in combination or in sequence with anti-PD-(L)1, unless patient was ineligible to receive such treatment.\n* Renal cell carcinoma, clear cell histology, previously treated with anti-PD(L)1-containing therapy and a VEGF targeted therapy as monotherapy or in combination. Patients should have documented disease progression following anti-PD(L)1-containing therapy.\n* Cutaneous melanoma, previously treated with anti-PD(L)1-containing therapy. Patients should have documented disease progression following anti-PD(L)1-containing therapy. Patients with BRAF V600-mutant melanoma must have also received prior therapy with a BRAF V600 inhibitor, with or without a MEK inhibitor.\n* Ovarian cancer, high-grade serous histology, na\u00efve to anti-PD(L)1 therapy, must have received one prior systemic therapy in platinum-resistant setting.\n* Nasopharyngeal carcinoma, non-keratinizing locally advanced recurrent or metastatic. Depending on the study arm, patients may be na\u00efve to anti-PD(L)1 therapy, or previously treated with platinum-based chemotherapy with or without anti-PD-(L)1.\n* Locally advanced unresectable or metastatic triple negative breast cancer, ovarian cancer (high-grade serous histology), anal cancer (squamous), MSI-H CRC, esophagogastric cancer, mesothelioma, and HNSCC.\n* Locally advanced unresectable or metastatic anal cancer (squamous), thymic carcinoma, MSI-H CRC, esophagogastric cancer, mesothelioma, and HNSCC, all na\u00efve to anti-PD(L)1 therapy and for whom anti PD(L)1 therapy is not available.\n* Triple negative breast cancer with historic PD-L1 CPS \u2265 1%, must have received at least one line of chemotherapy. In addition, these patients must have previously received sacituzumab govitecan, and in the case of a BRCA mutation a PARP inhibitor, if these treatments are locally approved and accessible to the patient.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Impaired cardiac function or clinically significant cardiac disease.\n* Use of agents known to prolong the QT interval unless they can be permanently discontinued for the duration of study.\n* History of severe hypersensitivity reactions to any ingredient of study drug(s) and other mAbs and/or their excipients.\n* Active, known or suspected autoimmune disease. Patients with vitiligo, type I diabetes, residual hypothyroidism only requiring hormone replacement, psoriasis not requiring systemic treatment or conditions not expected to recur may be considered. Patients previously exposed to anti-PD-1/PD-L1 treatment who are adequately treated for skin rash or with replacement therapy for endocrinopathies should not be excluded.\n* Any evidence of interstitial lung disease (ILD) or pneumonitis, or a prior history of ILD or non-infectious pneumonitis requiring high-dose glucocorticoids.\n* Patients who discontinued prior anti-PD-(L)1 therapy due to an anti-PD-(L)1-related toxicity (applicable to the KFA115 in combination with pembrolizumab treatment arms).\n* Patients with symptomatic peripheral neuropathy limiting instrumental activities of daily living.\n\nOther protocol-defined inclusion/exclusion criteria may apply",
