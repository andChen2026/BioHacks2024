echocardiogram may be used if multi gated acquisition (MUGA) scan is not available, but the same test must be used throughout the study to evaluate LVEF\n* Computed tomography of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis (CT CAP) and bone scan performed within 30 days prior to study entry and does not demonstrate metastatic disease\n* Patients may not receive concurrent treatment with other investigational or commercial agent(s) for treatment of their breast cancer\n* The patient or, if applicable, her legally authorized representative must have signed and dated an Institutional Review Board (IRB)-approved consent form that conforms to federal and institutional guidelines\n* Patients must be eligible to undergo surgery, either lumpectomy or mastectomy for local treatment of the breast cancer; surgical margins at discretion of surgeon per National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines; axillary exploration at discretion of surgeon but all patients minimally have sentinel lymph node evaluation at time of surgery\n* Imaging by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), ultrasound and/or mammogram and physical exam to document lesions size must be performed within 30 days of study entry\n* Must not exhibit a non-healing wound or any skin breakdown\n* Before administering liposomal doxorubicin, patients must wait 4-6 weeks after surgery\n* Submission of tumor samples from the diagnostic biopsy and breast surgery is required for all patients\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding\n* Second primary malignancy except most situ carcinoma (e.g. in situ carcinoma of the cervix, adequately treated non-melanomatous carcinoma of the skin) or other malignancy treated at least 5 years previously with no evidence of recurrence\n* Definitive clinical or radiologic evidence of metastatic disease; imaging must have been performed no greater than 30 days prior to initiation of chemotherapy\n* Diagnosis of inflammatory breast cancer\n* History of hypersensitivity reactions attributed to a conventional formulation of doxorubicin hydrochloride (HCL) or the components of doxil, paclitaxel, or carboplatin\n* Serious concomitant systemic disorders (including active infections or chronic infection requiring suppressive antibiotics) that would compromise the safety of the patient or compromise the patient's ability to complete the study, at the discretion of the investigator\n* Myocardial infarct or unstable angina within 6 months before enrollment, New York Heart Association (NYHA) class II or greater heart failure, uncontrolled angina, severe uncontrolled ventricular arrhythmias, clinically significant pericardial disease, valvular disease with documented compromise in cardiac function, or electrocardiographic evidence of acute ischemic or active conduction system abnormalities\n* Prior anthracycline, platinum salt, or taxane for any malignancy\n* Known or active hepatitis B or C with abnormal liver function tests\n* Significant vascular disease (e.g., aortic aneurysm, aortic dissection)\n* Symptomatic peripheral vascular disease\n* Evidence of bleeding diathesis or coagulopathy\n* Intrinsic lung disease resulting in moderate to severe dyspnea\n* History of a major organ allograft or condition requiring chronic immunosuppression, e.g., kidney, liver, lung, heart, bone marrow transplant, or autoimmune diseases; this includes treatment with corticosteroids within one month (dose of \\>= 10 mg/day methylprednisolone equivalent) (excluding inhaled steroids); patients who have received corneal transplants, cadaver skin, or bone transplants are eligible\n* Nervous system disorder (paresthesias, peripheral motor neuropathy, or peripheral sensory neuropathy) \\>= grade 2, per the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 4.0 (CTCAE v4.0)\n* Conditions that would prohibit administration of corticosteroids",
