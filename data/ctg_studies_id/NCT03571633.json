Note: the use of filgrastim (non pegylated form only) is authorized prior to the randomisation.\n* Patients requiring the concomitant use of any forbidden treatment including: Any other anti-cancer treatments not listed in the protocol, including chemotherapy, radiotherapy, immunotherapy, targeted therapy or biologic therapy for cancer treatment, Any investigational treatment.\n* Any contra-indication to trastuzumab, paclitaxel, and pegfilgrastim respective SPCs including:Hypersensitivity to trastuzumab, murine proteins, or to any of the excipients listed in trastuzumab SPC, Severe dyspnea at rest due to complications of advanced malignancy or requiring supplementary oxygen therapy, Hypersensitivity to pegfilgrastim or filgrastim, or to any of the excipients listed in SPC, Hereditary problems of fructose intolerance, Hypersensitivity to paclitaxel or to any excipient, particularly macrogolglycerol ricinoleate, Patients with history of or active cardiac disease including myocardial infarction (MI), angina pectoris requiring medical treatment, congestive heart failure NYHA (New York Heart Association) Class \u2265II, other cardiomyopathy, cardiac arrhythmia requiring medical treatment, clinically significant cardiac valvular disease, and hemodynamic effective pericardial effusion.\n* Active secondary malignancy unless this malignancy is not expected to interfere with the evaluation of study endpoints and is approved by the sponsor. Examples of the latter include basal or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin, in-situ carcinoma of the cervix.
