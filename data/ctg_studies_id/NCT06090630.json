    "eligibilityCriteria": "Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Malignant tumor subjects must have malignant needle biopsy results with concordant imaging and pathological findings.\n* Benign tumor subjects must have benign needle biopsy results. Benign subjects will only include those with concordant benign imaging and pathological findings.\n* Control subjects: healthy and have no previous history of any type of cancers.\n* The women should be able to read and understand English. Hence, non-English speaking subjects will be excluded. However, if there will be a necessity of translating the written informed consent form in the subject's mother tongue (such as Hispanic, Chinese, Persian, Indian, etc.), the translated consent form will be submitted for expedited approval to the office of University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) Institutional Review Board (IRB).\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Pregnant women will be excluded.\n* Breast feeding women.\n* MR incompatible items: cardiac pacemaker, aneurysm clip, heart valve prosthesis, nitroglycerin transdermal patch, implanted cardiac defibrillator, implanted electrode, including pacing wires, cochlear implant, other, implanted drug infusion device, implanted insulin pump, intravascular coil, filter or stent: (e.g., Gianturco coil, Gunther inferior vena cava \\[IVC\\] filter, etc.), intraventricular shunt, neurostimulator/biostimulator, Swan-Ganz catheter, any type of electronic, mechanical or magnetic implant, any type of implant held in place by a magnet, artificial limb or joint, contraceptive device (e.g., intrauterine device \\[IUD\\], diaphragm), dentures, ear implant, eye/orbital implant, foreign body (e.g., shrapnel, bullet, etc.), halo vest or metallic cervical fixation device, orthopedic item (for example: pins, rods, screws, clips, plates, wires, etc.), surgical clip or staple, vascular access port, wire mesh, hearing aid (must remove prior to the exam), tattooed eyeliner (a small percentage of patients with tattooed eyeliner have experienced transient skin irritation in association with MRI). The patients using transdermal patches will be asked to remove the patch and will be excluded if the patch cannot be removed.",
