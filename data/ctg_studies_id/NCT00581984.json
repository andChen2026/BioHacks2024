This does not include normal variants of asymmetry. Examples include, but are not limited to:Pectus excavatum, Pectus carinatum; Thoracic hypoplasia (Poland's syndrome, Scoliosis; Isolated rib deformities; Tuberous breasts; Congenital absence\n  * Revision of implant procedure due to any of the following circumstances;\n* Previous augmentation or reconstruction with silicone- or saline-filled implants where problems exist, such as implant. rapture or significant capsular contracture (Baker Grade III or IV) requiring revision;\n\n  * Contralateral mammaplasty in unaffected breast as a result of the affected breast requiring surgery (for one of the aforementioned circumstances), when medically indicated to provide symmetry.\n* Adequate tissue available to cover implants.\n* Saline-filled implants are not an appropriate choice.\n* Willingness to follow all study requirements, such as agreeing to all required follow-up visits, and acceptance of the risks involved as indicated by signing of the Patient Informed Consent document.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Advanced fibrocystic disease considered to be premalignant-without accompanying subcutaneous mastectomy.\n* Existing carcinoma of the breast, without mastectomy.\n* Abscess or infection in the body at the time of enrollment.\n* Pregnant or nursing.\n* Have any disease, including uncontrolled diabetes; which is clinically known to impact wound healing ability.\n* Show tissue characteristics which are clinically incompatible with mammaplasty, such as tissue damage resulting from radiation, inadequate tissue, compromised vascularity or ulceration.\n* Have, or under treatment for, any condition which, in the opinion of the surgeon, may constitute an unwarranted surgical risk.\n* Show psychological characteristics which, in the opinion of the surgeon, may be incompatible with the surgical procedure and the prosthesis, such as inappropriate attitude or motivation.\n* Wish to have augmentation mammaplasty, but do not have at least one of the diagnoses identified in Patient Inclusion Criteria item G #2, pages 7 \\& 8.\n* Are not willing to undergo further surgery for revision, if medically required.\n* Diagnosis of lupus or scleroderma.\n* Replacement of saline-filled implants solely for a less than desirable cosmetic outcome, such as wrinkling.",
