    "eligibilityCriteria": "Inclusion Criteria:\n\n1. All patients must have a diagnosis of epithelial breast carcinoma which is, according to TNM classification:\n\n   * Any T\n   * With Positive (N+) or Negative (N-) Lymph-Node depending on the patient profile (see below criteria n\u00b03)\n   * And Non metastatic (M0)\n2.

Patients must have completed all their local and regional treatments including adequate surgery and radiation therapy, and at least 6 cycles of chemotherapy (neoadjuvant and/or adjuvant) according to institutional and national standards.\n5. The time interval between the end of all the first line standard treatment (completion of surgery, chemotherapy and radiation therapy) should be at least 1 month and within a maximum of 18 months before inclusion in the study.\n6.
