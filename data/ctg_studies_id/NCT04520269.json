    "eligibilityCriteria": "Inclusion Criteria:\n\nPatients may be included in the study only if they meet all of the following criteria:\n\n* Age \\> or = 21 years.\n* Histological or cytological diagnosis of malignant advanced solid tumors refractory to standard therapy or for which no suitable effective standard therapy exists.\n\n  o Patients who fit above criteria will be pre-screened for presence of 1q21.3 amplification using a plasma assay based on digital PCR. Patients with tumors that exhibit 1q21.3amplification will be enrolled. Positive 1q21.3 amplification is defined as more than 3 standard deviations above the mean comparing the averaged copy number ratio of 3 genes (TUFT1, S100A8 and S100A7) relative to the reference gene RPP30 measure in sample (13).\n* ECOG 0-2\n* Has measureable or evaluable disease based on RECIST 1.1 criteria\n* Estimated life expectancy of at least 12 weeks.\n* Has documented progressive disease from last line of therapy\n* Has recovered from acute toxicities from prior anti-cancer therapies\n* Adequate organ function including the following:\n\n  * Bone marrow:\n\n    * Absolute neutrophil (segmented and bands) count (ANC) \\> or = 1.5 x 109/L\n    * Platelets \\> or = 100 x 109/L\n    * Hemoglobin \\> or = 8 x 109/L\n  * Hepatic:\n\n    * Bilirubin \\< or = 1.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN),\n    * ALT or AST \\< or = 2.5x ULN, (or \\< or = 5 X with liver metastases)\n  * Renal:\n\n    * Creatinine \\< or = 1.5x ULN\n* Signed informed consent from patient\n* Able to comply with study-related procedures.\n* Prior therapy (patients enrolled in phase Ib may be enrolled if they fulfil prior therapy criteria for either Cohort A or Cohort B)\n\n  * Cohort A only: Has received at least 2 lines of systemic therapy (endocrine or chemotherapy) in the palliative setting. Chemotherapy in an adjuvant setting for which patients relapsed within 6 months of completion can be considered as line(s) of palliative therapy.\n  * Cohort B only: Any number of prior lines of palliative chemotherapy.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\nPatients will be excluded from the study for any of the following reasons:\n\n* Treatment within the last 30 days with any investigational drug.\n* Concurrent administration of any other tumour therapy, including cytotoxic chemotherapy, hormonal therapy, and immunotherapy.\n* Major surgery within 28 days of study drug administration.\n* Active infection that in the opinion of the investigator would compromise the patient's ability to tolerate therapy.\n* Pregnancy.\n* Breast feeding.\n* Serious concomitant disorders that would compromise the safety of the patient or compromise the patient's ability to complete the study, at the discretion of the investigator.\n* Significant recent bleeding history defined as CTCAE grade 2 or higher within the past 3 months, unless precipitated by an inciting event (e.g. surgery, trauma, injury).\n* Suboptimal cardiac function, defined by:\n\n  * Any history of CTCAE grade \\> or = 2 non-dysrhythmia cardiac conditions within the last 6 months\n  * New York Heart Association class II, III or IV congestive cardiac failure\n  * Left ventricular ejection fraction of \\<45%\n* QTc prolongation of \\>450ms as assessed by ECG or other factors that increase the risk of QT interval prolongation\n* Second primary malignancy that is clinically detectable at the time of consideration for study enrollment.\n* Symptomatic brain metastasis.\n* History of significant neurological or mental disorder, including seizures or dementia.\n* Unable to comply with study procedures\n* Systemic treatment with a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor or storn CYP450 inducer within 14 days prior to treatment Day 1\n\nPhase Ib lead-in can recruit patients who fulfil critieria for either Cohort A or Cohort B AND all other inclusion/exclusion criteria",
