Prior treatment:\n\n   * Previously received no more than 1 prior lines of systemic treatment with trastuzumab regimen for repetitive metastatic diabetes \\[including anti-HER2 ADC, subsequent meaning is the same\\]\n\n     1. The early stage includes trastuzumab-containing regimen treatment\uff0c or trastuzumab-containing regimen that relapses more than 1 year after the end of adjuvant treatment, and subsequent treatment is included as the first-line anti-HER2 treatment;\n     2.
