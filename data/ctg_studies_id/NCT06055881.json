Patients with asymptomatic and stable, treated CNS lesions (radiation and/or surgery and/or other CNS-directed therapy who have not received corticosteroids for at least 4 weeks) are allowed.\n  * Active connective tissue disease that is felt by the treatment team to pose an excess risk of toxicity.\n  * Prior radiation that overlaps with the intended treatment volume such that, in the opinion of the patient's Radiation Oncologist, radiotherapy to progressing sites will not be safe.\n\n    * NOTE: patients with some dose overlap with prior radiotherapy that is deemed safe by the patient's Radiation Oncologist can be included in the trial.",
