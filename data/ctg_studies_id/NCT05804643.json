The cardiac implantable electronic device (CIED) such as pacemakers, implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICDs) and cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) devices.\n  2. Metallic intraocular foreign bodies.\n  3. Implantable neurostimulation systems\n  4. Cochlear implants/ear implant: bone-anchored hearing aid (BAHA) cochlear implant type can be scanned on a 1.5-tesla scanner only after the patient removes the battery. Cochlear implant wrapping scheduling must take place before the patient's MRI appointment.\n  5. Drug infusion pumps (insulin delivery, analgesic drugs, or chemotherapy pumps): If possible, the patient has to remove the device.\n  6. Catheters with metallic components (Swan-Ganz catheter)\n  7. Metallic fragments such as bullets, shotgun pellets, and metal shrapnel\n  8. Cerebral artery aneurysm clips\n  9. Magnetic dental implants\n  10. Tissue expander\n  11. Artificial limb\n  12. Hearing aid",
