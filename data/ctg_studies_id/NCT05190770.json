Once patient is enrolled on study (on or before Day 1), patient must be able to discontinue other topicals (including topical steroids, Silvadene, calcineurin inhibitors) to the treatment area\n* Patients have completed surgery or chemotherapy \u2265 4 weeks prior to start of radiation therapy. Patients may receive antibody-drug conjugates at any time before/during/after study\n* Women of childbearing potential (WCBP) must have a negative serum pregnancy test at Screening and a negative urine pregnancy test at Baseline (Day 0) and documented monthly.\n* WCBP must agree to abstrain from sex or use a highly effective method of birth control\\* from the time of consent through visit 5.\n\n  * Adequate contraceptive methods include those with a low failure rate, i.e., less than 1% per year, when used consistently and correctly, such as abstinence from sexual intercourse, and some double barrier methods (condom with spermicide) in conjunction with use by the partner of an intrauterine device, diaphragm with spermicide, oral contraceptives, birth control patch or vaginal ring, or injectable or implanted contraceptives.
