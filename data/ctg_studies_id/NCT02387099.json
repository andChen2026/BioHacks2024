Recurrence while on, or following completion of an adjuvant treatment with Letrozole or Anastrozole, or\n  2. Progression while on or following completion of Letrozole or Anastrozole treatment for ABC/MBC.

Other prior anticancer therapy, e.g. Tamoxifen, Fulvestrant, Exemestane, is also allowed. Patients must have recovered to grade 1 or better from any adverse events (except alopecia) related to previous therapy prior to enrollment.\n* At least 4 weeks since radiotherapy, with full recovery. The measurable disease must be completely outside the radiation field or there must be pathologic proof of newly progressive disease.\n\nExclusion Criteria (most important):\n\n* Concurrent immunotherapy or hormonal therapy (contraceptive and/or replacement therapy). Bisphosphonates or denosumab may be continued or started before randomization.\n* Life expectancy of less than 3 months.\n* Parenchymal brain metastases, unless adequately controlled by surgery and/or radiotherapy.\n* Any ongoing toxicity from prior anti-cancer therapy that is grade 3-4 and/or that is progressing in severity, except alopecia or anemia controlled by growth factors.\n* Known or suspected congestive heart failure (\\>NYHA I) and/or coronary heart disease, angina pectoris requiring anti-anginal medication, previous history of myocardial infarction \u2264 6months, evidence of transmural infarction on ECG, un- or poorly controlled arterial hypertension (i.e. BP \\>150/100 mmHg under treatment with two antihypertensive drugs), rhythm abnormalities requiring permanent treatment, clinically significant valvular heart disease.\n* Currently active infection.\n* History of other malignancies within the last 5 years which significantly affect the diagnosis, assessment or prognosis of metastatic breast cancer.\n* Malabsorption syndrome or insufficient gastrointestinal function, preexisting diagnosis of ulcerative colitis.\n* Concurrent treatment with other experimental drugs; participation in another clinical trial with any investigational not marketed drug within 30 days prior to study entry.\n* Insufficiently controlled diabetes, known HIV infection or chronic hepatitis B or C and seriously impaired liver function (Child-Pugh, class A, B or C).",
