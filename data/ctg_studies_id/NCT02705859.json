    "eligibilityCriteria": "Inclusion Criteria\n\nPatients are eligible to be included in the study only if they meet all of the following criteria:\n\n1. Adult women \u2265 18 years of age.\n2. Histologically confirmed HER2-positive breast cancer:\n\n   Documented HER2 overexpression by local laboratory (IHC 3+ or FISH or CISH positive).\n\n   IHC 3+ or FISH/CISH positive on diagnostic breast biopsy or surgical breast resection sample or metastatic disease site biopsy.\n3. Recurrent incurable or metastatic breast cancer:\n\n   Eligible recurrent disease is recurrent disease that is considered incurable by the treating oncologist. Many local-only recurrences are treated with curative intent; a treatment plan with curative intent for a local-only recurrence would indicate that the patient is not eligible for this clinical trial. A local-only recurrence must be considered incurable by the treating oncologist for the patient to be eligible.\n4. At least one measurable lesion according to RECIST criteria (Version 1.1). Patients with bone only disease are not eligible.\n5. Patient has received at least one trastuzumab-based or T-DM1-based treatment regimen in the setting of metastatic disease or incurable locoregional recurrence. A trastuzumab-based or T-DM1-based treatment regimen is considered as any treatment regimen that includes trastuzumab or T-DM1.\n\n   Patients must have had at least 1 line of therapy for metastatic and/or incurable locoregional recurrent disease to be eligible. A patient is eligible regardless of the period of time from adjuvant therapy so long as she has disease that is progressing after at least 1 line of trastuzumab-based therapy in the setting of metastatic disease and/or incurable locoregional recurrence.\n6. Disease progression during or following at least 1 prior trastuzumab-based or trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1) based treatment regimen in the setting of metastatic disease or incurable locoregional recurrence.\n7. ECOG performance status \u2264 2.\n8. Life expectancy of at least 3 months.\n9. Availability of fresh tissue and/or archival tumour tissue at screening.\n10. Women of childbearing potential must agree to use a highly effective method of contraception when sexually active. This applies from signing of the informed consent form until at least 100 days after the last study drug administration. The investigator or a designated associate is required to advise the patient how to achieve an adequate birth control. Highly effective contraception is defined in the study as methods that achieve a failure rate of less than 1% per year when used consistently and correctly. Such methods include:\n\n    i. Combined (oestrogen and progestogen containing) hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of ovulation (oral, intravaginal, transdermal).\n\n    ii. Progestogen-only hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of ovulation (oral, injectable and implantable).\n\n    iii. Intrauterine device (IUD).\n\n    iv. Intrauterine hormone-releasing system (IUS).\n\n    v. Bilateral tubal occlusion.\n\n    vi. Successfully vasectomised partner.\n\n    vii. Sexual abstinence.\n11. Adequate baseline laboratory values collected no more than 14 days before starting study treatment:\n\n    Total bilirubin \u2264 1.5 x ULN (\\< 3 x ULN for patients with metastatic disease in the liver).\n\n    Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) \u2264 3.0 x ULN (\u2264 5 x ULN for patients with liver involvement from breast cancer).\n\n    Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) \u2265 30 mL/min/1.73 m2 according to the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) abbreviated formula. If not on target, this evaluation may be repeated once after at least 24 hours either according to the MDRD abbreviated formula or by 24 hour sampling. If the later result is within acceptable range, it may be used to fulfil the inclusion criteria instead.\n\n    International normalized ratio (INR) and partial thromboplastin time (PTT) \u2264 1.5 x ULN. Patients who are therapeutically treated with an agent such as warfarin or heparin will be allowed to participate provided that no prior underlying coagulopathy disorder. Close monitoring of these patients (Day 15 of Cycle 1 and Day 1 of each cycle) will be performed until INR/PTT is stable based on a measurement that is pre- dose as defined by the local standard of care.\n\n    Platelet count \u2265 75 x 109/L. For patients with breast cancer bone marrow infiltration, platelet count \u2265 50 x 109/L.\n\n    Haemoglobin (Hb) \u2265 8 g/dL.\n\n    Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) \u2265 1 x 109/L. For patients with malignant bone marrow infiltration, ANC count \u2265 0.75 x 109/L.\n\n    Fasting blood glucose \u2264 6.0 mmol/L if not diabetic or \u2264 8.9 mmol/L if diabetic.\n12. Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), at or above the Institutions lower limit of normal, as determined by ECHO or MUGA.\n13. Patients must have recovered from clinically significant side effects associated with prior radiotherapy and chemotherapy with the exception of fatigue or neuropathy.\n\nExclusion criteria\n\nPatients who meet any of the following criteria at the time of screening will be excluded from study registration:\n\n1. Known breast cancer involvement of the brain, unless adequately controlled based on the clinical judgement of the treating physician.\n2. Congestive heart failure \\> New York Heart Association (NYHA) class II.\n3. Unstable angina (angina symptoms at rest), new-onset angina (begun within the last 3 months). Myocardial infarction less than 6 months before registration.\n4. Uncontrolled arterial hypertension despite optimal medical management (per investigator's opinion).\n5.

Non-healing wound, ulcer, or bone fracture.\n8. Active, clinically serious infections \\> CTCAE Grade 2 (CTCAE v4.0).\n9. Known history of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection.\n10. Hepatitis B (HBV) or hepatitis C (HCV). All patients must be screened for HBV and HCV up to 28 days prior to study drug start using the routine hepatitis virus laboratory panel. Patients who test positive for Hepatitis B surface Antigen (HBsAg) or Hepatitis B core Antibody (HBcAb) will be eligible if they are negative for HBV-DNA; patients who test positive for anti-HCV antibody will be eligible if they are negative for HCV- RNA.\n11.
