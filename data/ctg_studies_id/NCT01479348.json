Pregnant women are excluded from this study because the effects of 18F-FdCyd in pregnancy are not known. Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to administration of 18F-FdCyd in the mother, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother receives 18F-FdCyd\n* Participants with any co-existing medical or psychiatric condition that is likely to interfere with study procedures and/or results",
