    "eligibilityCriteria": "* INCLUSION CRITERIA:\n\nInclusion criteria for participation in the study are women, ages 40-65 years of age, who are undergoing a radiologically-guided biopsy (stereotactic- ultrasound-guided). We will NOT exclude subjects for current or past use of exogenous hormones; prior hysterectomy or salpingoophorectomy or presentation with a breast mass. Although most biopsies are prompted by a radiologic finding (typically abnormal calcifications or masses), some biopsies are performed for symptoms that are unassociated with a radiologic finding, such as nipple discharge, palpable mass, discomfort, etc. Elevated density per se is not a biopsy indication. ALL women referred for radiologically guided biopsy, irrespective of the indication, will be considered eligible for the pilot study.\n\nEXCLUSION CRITERIA:\n\nWe will EXCLUDE women who have a prior history of breast cancer, have had an EXCISIONAL breast biopsy within one year, women who have implants in place, women taking tamoxifen or raloxifene for chemoprevention and women who have received non-surgical treatments for cancers of other organs.",
