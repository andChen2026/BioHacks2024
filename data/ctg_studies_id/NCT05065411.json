Previous therapy with testosterone and testosterone-like agents is acceptable with a 30-day washout (if previous testosterone therapy was long term depot within the past 6 months, the site should contact the Medical Monitor) or any other androgenic agent.\n* Treatment with any of the following hormone therapies for metastatic breast cancer. Prior use in the adjuvant or neoadjuvant setting is allowed if the treatment is discontinued greater than 30 days prior to randomization\n\n  * Estrogens\n  * Megestrol acetate\n  * Testosterone\n* All other concurrent anticancer treatments (including, but not limited to, all SERMs, estrogen blocking agents unless randomized to Control Treatment Group, and CDK 4/6 inhibitors unless randomized to the abemaciclib in Enobosarm Combination Group)\n* An abnormal ECG result which, based on the investigator's clinical judgment, would place the subject at increased risk\n* The patient has a personal history of any of the following conditions: syncope of cardiovascular etiology, ventricular arrhythmia of pathological origin (including, but not limited to, ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation), or sudden cardiac arrest.\n* Has a known additional, invasive, malignancy that is progressing or required active treatment in the last 5 years \\[note: subjects with basal cell carcinoma of the skin, squamous cell carcinoma of the skin, ductal breast carcinoma in situ, bladder cancer (superficial curatively treated), or cervical carcinoma in situ that have undergone potentially curative therapy are not excluded\\]\n* Pregnant, lactating, or breastfeeding, or intending to become pregnant during the study or within 60 days after the final dose of study treatment\n* The patient has active systemic bacterial infection (requiring intravenous \\[IV\\] antibiotics at time of initiating study treatment), fungal infection, or detectable viral infection (such as known human immunodeficiency virus positivity or with known active hepatitis B or C \\[for example, hepatitis B surface antigen positive\\].
