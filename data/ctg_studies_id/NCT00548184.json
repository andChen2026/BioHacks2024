Locally advanced cancers must be of clinical and/or radiologic size \\>3 cm, or \\>2 cm with clinical evidence of axillary nodal involvement. (If tumors are less than 3 cm, we will use radiologically measured tumor size to determine the minimal tumor size for eligibility and in assessing tumor size during follow-up).\n* HER2 overexpressing tumors defined as HercepTest score of 3+, or \\> 10% cells moderately or strongly HER2 positive by other methods, or Allred semi-quantitative score of \\>5, or gene amplified.\n* Negative serum pregnancy test (HCG) within 7 days of starting study, if of child-bearing potential.\n* Kidney and liver function tests - all within 1.5 times the institution's upper limit of normal.\n* Performance status (WHO scale) less than 2 and life expectancy more than 6 months.\n* Age at least 18 years.\n* No brain or leptomeningeal disease.\n* No previous or current malignancies at other sites within the last 5 years, with exception of adequately treated cone-biopsied in situ carcinoma of the cervix uteri and basal or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin.\n\nNote: The presence of pathological involvement of axillary nodes will be assessed and agreed upon by two investigators.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Pregnancy or unwillingness to use a reliable contraceptive method in women of child-bearing potential.\n* Severe underlying chronic illness or disease.\n* Cardiomyopathy or baseline LVEF less than 50%.\n* Other investigational drugs while on study.\n* Severe or uncontrolled hypertension, history of congestive heart failure or severe coronary arterial disease.\n* Malabsorption syndrome, disease significantly affecting gastrointestinal function, or resection of the stomach or small bowel. Subjects with ulcerative colitis are also excluded\n* Taking any lapatinib-prohibited medication within 7 days of first dose of study medications. (See Prohibited Medications List in protocol.)",
