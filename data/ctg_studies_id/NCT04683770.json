    "eligibilityCriteria": "Inclusion Criteria:\n\n1. Adult female patients (aged 18-80 years, including 18 and 80 years) with advanced breast cancer confirmed by pathology or imaging are not suitable for surgical resection or radiotherapy for the purpose of cure;\n2. Pathological examination confirmed that ER and/or PR were positive and HER-2 was negative (ER expression: immunohistochemical staining \\> 1% of tumor cells; PR expression: immunohistochemical staining of tumor cells \\> 1%; HER-2 negative: immunohistochemical staining of 0,1 +, or fish / CISH negative)\n3. No more than four systematic treatments have been used for advanced diseases\n4. It is expected that the patients can be followed up at least once after the treatment plan is formulated.\n5. The WHO physical status was 0-2 points, and the expected survival time was not less than 3 months;\n6. No more than four systematic treatment regimens have been received in the past for advanced diseases\n7. There was at least one measurable lesion (short diameter of lymph node \u2265 15mm) in imaging examination within 2 weeks before enrollment, and a conventional CT scan was performed. The diameter of spiral CT scan was more than or equal to 20 mm or more than 10 mm.\n8. Prior treatment-related toxicity should be reduced to NCI CTCAE (version 4.03) \u2264 1 degree (except for hair loss or other toxicity judged by the researcher as having no risk to the safety of patients)\n9. Within one week before admission, blood routine examination was basically normal: A. white blood cell count (WBC) \u2265 3.0 \u00d7 10 \\^ 9 / L; B. neutrophil count (ANC) \u2265 1.5 \u00d7 10 \\^ 9 / L; C. platelet count (PLT) \u2265 100 \u00d7 10 \\^ 9 / L;\n10. Within one week before admission, liver, and kidney function tests were basically normal (based on the normal values of laboratories in each research center): A. total bilirubin (TBIL) \u2264 1.5 \u00d7 ULN; B. alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase (ALT / AST) \u2264 2.5 \u00d7 ULN (liver metastases \u2264 5xuln); C. serum creatinine \u2264 1.5 \u00d7 ULN or creatinine clearance rate (CCR) \u2265 60 ml/min\uff1b\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n1. The diagnosis of any other malignant tumor within 3 years before enrollment, except for basal cell or squamous cell skin cancer or cervical carcinoma in situ after adequate treatment;\n2. Poor compliance or the situation that the researchers think is not suitable to be included in the study;\n3. Pregnant or lactating patients;\n4. Patients who had received transplantation before;\n5. Patients who had previously received stem cell therapy;\n6. Patients who have received any immunotherapy that may introduce exogenous DNA and other patients who may introduce exogenous DNA within 4 weeks;\n7. Have received more than four systematic treatments for advanced diseases;\n8. May interfere with the concomitant diseases or conditions involved in the study, or have any serious medical barriers that may affect the safety of the subjects (e.g., uncontrollable heart disease, hypertension, active or uncontrollable infection, active hepatitis B virus infection);",
