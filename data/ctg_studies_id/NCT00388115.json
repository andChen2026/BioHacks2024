    "eligibilityCriteria": "Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Females of ages \u226518 years.\n* Core biopsy proven invasive breast cancer OR\n* Core biopsy proven low or intermediate grade DCIS.\n* Tumor less than or equal to 2.0 cm in diameter.\n* No prior surgical treatment for breast cancer within 30 days.\n* Life expectancy of \\> 10 years, not including the diagnosis of cancer.\n* ECOG performance status of 0-2.\n* Informed consent given.\n* Multifocal invasive breast cancer patients are eligible. All tumors that are palpable or visualized by USS can be treated.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Male subjects.\n* Ages \\< 18 years.\n* Breast tumor \\> 2.0 cm in diameter.\n* Evidence of distant metastatic disease.\n* Evidence of diffuse calcification suggestive of extensive or multifocal DCIS.\n* High grade DCIS or presence of comedo-necrosis because these lesions can be associated with invasive breast cancer, which would go undetected if the lesion is entirely destroyed by the RF ablation.",
