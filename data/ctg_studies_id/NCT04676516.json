Cardiac abnormalities as evidenced by any of the following:\n\n    1. Baseline QTcF interval \u2265 480 msec\n    2. Clinically significant conduction abnormalities or arrhythmias\n    3. Presence of cardiac pacemaker or defibrillator with a paced ventricular rhythm limiting ECG analysis.\n    4.

GSK3326595 should not be co-administered with potent inhibitors of either BCRP or Pgp such inhibitors include cyclosporine, tacrolimus, and ketoconazole\n15. Any clinically significant gastrointestinal (GI) abnormalities that may alter absorption, such as malabsorption syndrome, chronic gastrointestinal disease, or major resection of the stomach and/or bowels that could preclude adequate absorption of the study medication.\n16. Severe, uncontrolled systemic disease (respiratory, cardiac, renal, hepatic, bleeding)\n17. Currently active liver or biliary disease\n18. History of active HIV, Hepatitis B or C infection.\n19. Any other criteria which, in the investigator's opinion, renders the patient ineligible to be on study.\n20. Subjects with signs/symptoms suggestive of COVID-19 or known COVID-19 positive contacts in the past 14 days would be tested as per local Public Health and/or Institutional Guidelines. If patients are COVID-19 positive at the time of screening, they would be excluded from the trial.",
