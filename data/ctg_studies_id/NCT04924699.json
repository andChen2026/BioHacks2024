Phase III: patients who have received 1 or 2 prior lines of anti-HER2 therapy for locally advanced or recurrent/metastatic breast cancer (in the case of (neo) adjuvant therapy, such (neo) adjuvant therapy also counts as one line of anti-HER2 therapy if relapse occurs within 12 months of (neo) adjuvant therapy); have received prior treatment with trastuzumab (containing a trastuzumab biosimilar) and anti-HER2-TKI; have not received prior treatment with ADCs;\n\n  6. Patients must have imaging evidence of tumor progression during or after the most recent treatment confirmed by the investigator and have at least one measurable lesion baseline according to RECIST 1.1;\n\n  7.

Or the pericardial effusion with combined clinical symptoms;\n\n  5. Any severe or uncontrolled systemic disease, uncontrolled heart disease, uncontrolled diabetes, and active bleeding signs judged by the investigator;\n\n  6. Evidence of active infection, including hepatitis B, hepatitis C or human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, active bacteria infection requiring systematic anti-infective therapy, infection caused by other viruses, fungi, rickettsia or parasites;\n\n  7. History of hypersensitivity to any component of MRG002 or history of hypersensitivity of \u2265 Grade 3 to trastuzumab injection;\n\n  8. Subjects with active autoimmune disease or a history of autoimmune disease are receiving immunosuppressive agents or systemic hormone therapy, and are still receiving within 2 weeks prior to enrollment/randomization;\n\n  9. History of interstitial pneumonia, severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, severe pulmonary insufficiency, symptomatic bronchospasm, etc;\n\n  10.
