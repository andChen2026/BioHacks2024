Please note: there is no washout period required for trastuzumab, pertuzumab, for patients who have developed new parenchymal brain metastases while on these agents.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Leptomeningeal metastases Please note: leptomeningeal metastases may be allowed if it is limited to cranial metastasis (MRI spine should be completed, within 4 weeks of enrollment, to show that no other leptomeningeal metastases is present) and is not the only metastasis present in the brain.\n* Concurrent administration of lapatinib or other tyrosine kinase inhibitors other than sorafenib\n* Craniotomy or any other major surgery, open biopsy, or significant traumatic injury within 4 weeks of randomization.\n* Concurrent anti-cancer therapy (chemotherapy, hormonal therapy, radiation therapy, surgery, immunotherapy, biologic therapy, or tumor embolization) other than sorafenib, and protocol-specified whole-brain radiotherapy.\n* Use of any investigational drug within 30 days or 5 half-lives, whichever is longer, preceding enrollment.\n* Inability to comply with protocol and /or not willing or not available for follow-up assessments.\n* Any condition which in the investigator's opinion makes the patient unsuitable for the study participation.\n* Patient is incontinent of urine or stool (which would make them unable to tolerate lying still for 60 minutes).\n* Claustrophobia\n* Known allergic reaction to Gd-DTPA\n* Renal insufficiency with recent (\\<3 month old) creatinine \\>2.0",
