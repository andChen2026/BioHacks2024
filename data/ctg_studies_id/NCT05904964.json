Patients with stable brain metastasis or asymptomatic brain metastasis;\n6. ECOG physical condition score \u2264 2 points, and the estimated survival time is not less than 3 months;\n7. Prior treatment-related toxicity must be relieved to \u2264 1 degree (according to NCI CTCAE 5.0) before enrollment (except for hair loss or other toxicity that is considered as no risk to the safety of patients according to the judgment of the researcher);\n8.

Platelet count (PLT) \u2265 70 \u00d7 10\\^9\uff0fL;\n9. Liver, kidney and heart function tests were basically normal within one week before enrollment (based on the normal values of laboratories in each research center): A. total bilirubin (TBIL) \u2264 1.5 \u00d7 upper limit of normal value (ULN), B. alanine aminotransferase (ALT / AST) \u2264 2.5 \u00d7 ULN (liver metastasis patients \u2264 5xuln), C. serum creatinine \u2264 1.5 \u00d7 ULN or creatinine clearance rate (CCR) \u2265 60 ml / min; d. left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) \u2265 55%, e. QTcF(Fridericia correction) \u2264 470 ms;\n10. Patients understand the research process, voluntarily participate in the research, and sign the informed consent form.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n1. Patients who had received chemotherapy, radiotherapy, immunotherapy, and endocrine therapy for breast cancer within 2 weeks before enrollment.;\n2. Patients who had performed major surgery within 2 weeks before enrollment.\n3. Severe heart disease or discomfort within 12 months, including, but not limited to, the following: unstable angina pectoris, myocardial infarction, cerebral hemorrhage and cerebral infarction (except for silent lacunar cerebral infarction without treatment);\n4. Have active autoimmune diseases (such as corticosteroids or immunosuppressive drugs) requiring systemic treatment in the past 2 years, excluding those with adrenal insufficiency requiring corticosteroid replacement therapy;\n5. Have a clear history of neurological or mental disorders, including epilepsy or dementia;\n6. According to the judgment of the researchers, there are some accompanying diseases that seriously endanger the safety of patients or affect patients to complete the study.\n7.
