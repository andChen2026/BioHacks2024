    "eligibilityCriteria": "Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Patient meets all eligibility criteria for treatment of the tumors with the agents listed and has agreed to provide tissue and blood samples for this study\n\n  * Targeted therapy maybe as a singular/monotherapy or in combination with any Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved chemotherapies\n  * Patient's primary or recurrent disease is targeted-treatment naive or will be treated with a targeted therapy listed different from any previously-received targeted therapy or combination therapy as standard of care\n* Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status (PS) 0 or 1. Patients with a PS of 2 may be enrolled only at the discretion of the treating physician and radiologist\n* Have an advanced malignancy being treated with one of the agents listed. Advanced cancer is cancer that is unlikely to be cured or controlled with treatment. The cancer may have spread from where it first started to nearby tissue, lymph nodes, or distant parts of the body. Treatment may be given to help shrink the tumor, slow the growth of cancer cells, or relieve symptoms. Patients may be undergoing first or subsequent lines of therapy. In the case where an agent not listed is newly approved for one of the listed tumors, patients undergoing therapy with it will be able to enroll at discretion of the principal investigator (PI). This is to avoid any lag between FDA approval of a previously investigational agent and protocol modifications/updates\n* Have an advanced malignancy that meets one of the following criteria:\n\n  * Patients must have tumor amenable to image guided or direct vision biopsy and be willing and able to undergo a tumor biopsy for molecular profiling. The biopsy must not be associated with a significant risk of severe or major complications or death. In particular, endoscopic, open or laparoscopic surgical procedures are not to be performed to provide research specimens. However, research specimens may be provided if the patient needs to undergo such procedures for clinical reasons\n  * Severe or major complications are considered to be those\n\n    * Requiring therapy, minor hospitalization (more than overnight but \\< 48 hours \\[h\\])\n    * Requiring major therapy; unplanned increase in level of care, prolonged hospitalization \\> 48 h\n    * Resulting in permanent adverse sequelae\n    * Resulting in death\n  * Patient will be undergoing a procedure due to medical necessity during which the tissue may be collected. The following tumors may be collected only under the conditions specified and not for the sole purpose of the clinical trial:\n\n    * Brain biopsies: ONLY if the patient has medical necessity for craniotomy for clinical care\n    * Mediastinal, laparoscopic, gastrointestinal, or bronchial endoscopic biopsies: ONLY to be obtained incidentally to a clinically necessary procedure\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Uncontrolled intercurrent illness that in the physician's assessment would pose undue risk for biopsy\n* Patients currently enrolled or planning to be co-enrolled (while participating on the 10231 study) on a therapeutically interventional clinical trial aimed to treat the current malignancy\n* If the patient is on chronic anticoagulation treatment, they must be able and willing to have this treatment discontinued for the biopsy. Discontinuation procedures will be those of the treating site",
