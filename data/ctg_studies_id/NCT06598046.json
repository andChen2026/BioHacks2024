    "eligibilityCriteria": "Inclusion Criteria:\n\n1. Age \u226518 years old;\n2. Invasive breast cancer confirmed by histological or cytological examination, accompanied by metastatic disease; Patients with metastatic diseases not confirmed by pathology or cytology should obtain clear evidence of metastasis through physical examination or radiological research;\n3. Based on the pathological report of recent biopsy or other pathological specimens (confirmed by the laboratory of the participating research center), the histology and/or cytology are confirmed as triple negative breast cancer. The specific requirements include: a) the definition of negative human epidermal growth factor receptor 2(HER2): the immunohistochemistry (IHC) is 0 or 1+; If IHC was 2+, it was confirmed negative by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). B) Negative estrogen and progesterone receptors means that IHC examination shows ER \\< 10% and or PR \\< 10%, and the researcher evaluates that patients cannot benefit from endocrine therapy.\n4. Newly diagnosed brain metastases or brain metastases that have progressed after local treatment: patients with brain metastases who met all the criteria of this scheme before starting from September 1, 2023 and did not meet all the exclusion criteria can also be included;\n5. Patients must have measurable central nervous system diseases, defined as at least one brain parenchymal lesion, which can be accurately measured in at least one dimension through local radiological examination; And there is no central nervous system symptom or symptom controllable, so radiotherapy is not needed urgently.\n6. Patients who have previously received at least one taxane and/or one anthracycline antibiotic (as a treatment history of neoadjuvant therapy, adjuvant therapy or metastatic therapy or both);\n7. Allow (new) adjuvant therapy to have recurrence and metastasis after stopping using Utterone and/or Capecitabine for more than one year, or stop taking drugs for non-progressive reasons in the rescue stage;\n8. The physical status score (ECOGPS) of the eastern cancer cooperative group is 0-2, and the life expectancy is more than 12 weeks;\n9. Normal organ and bone marrow function; Blood routine examination was basically normal within one week before joining the group (based on the normal laboratory of each research center): neutrophil count (ANC) \u2265 1.5\u00d7 109/L; Hemoglobin (HB) \u2265 90g/L; Platelet count (PLT) \u2265 75\u00d7 109/L; Liver and kidney function tests were basically normal within one week before enrollment (based on the normal values of laboratories in each research center): total bilirubin (TBIL)\u22641.5\u00d7 upper limit of normal value (ULN); Alanine aminotransferase (SGPT/ALT)\u22642.5\u00d7ULN (patients with liver metastasis \u2264 5 XULN); Aspartate aminotransferase (SGOT/AST)\u22642.5\u00d7 upper limit of normal value (ULN); Creatinine clearance rate (Ccr)\u226560ml/min.\n10. Neuropathy should be \\< grade 2 within 4 weeks before enrollment (version 5.0 of ncictcae);\n11. No major organ dysfunction and no heart disease;\n12. Women and male patients with reproductive potential must agree to use appropriate contraceptive measures before the start of the study and during the study participation.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n1. Patients with extensive meningeal metastasis and brain metastasis who are ineffective in dehydration treatment with hormones or in urgent need of radiotherapy;\n2. Invasive breast cancer confirmed by histological or cytological examination, accompanied by metastatic disease; Patients with metastatic diseases not confirmed by pathology or cytology should obtain clear evidence of metastasis through physical examination or radiological research;\n3. Received chemotherapy, major surgery, targeted therapy or immunotherapy within 2 weeks before joining the group (the interval between targeted therapy and immunotherapy is at least 2 weeks or at least 5 half-lives, whichever is shorter); Received endocrine therapy within 1 week before joining the group; He had received nitrosourea or mitomycin chemotherapy within 6 weeks before joining the group;\n4. Receive unlisted clinical trial drugs within 4 weeks before entering the group;\n5.
