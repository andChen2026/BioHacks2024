    "eligibilityCriteria": "Inclusion Criteria:\n\n1. Female patients 18 to 65 years of age (both inclusive).\n2. Patient with pathologically (histologically or cytologically) confirmed, adenocarcino-ma metastatic breast cancer and candidate for chemotherapy. Note: Patients with de-novo Stage IV disease are eligible.\n3. With at least one measurable metastatic target lesion (based on RECIST criteria, ver-sion 1.1).\n4. Documentation of following prior to randomization:\n\n   \u2022 Documentation of HER2 gene amplification by fluorescent in situ hybridiza-tion (FISH); as defined by a ratio \\>2.0) OR documentation of HER2-overexpression by immunohistochemistry (IHC) (defined as IHC3+, or IHC2+ with FISH confirmation) (estrogen receptor/progesterone receptor positive subjects may be enrolled if they are HER2 positive) prior to randomization, see Section 6.4 for detailed criteria)\n5. Eastern Co-operative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1.\n6. Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of \u2265 50% at baseline (within 42 days of ran-domization) as measured by echocardiography (ECHO) or multiple gated acquisition (MUGA). Note: ECHO is the preferred method. If the patient is randomized, the same method of LVEF assessment (i.e., ECHO or MUGA) must be used throughout the study and it should preferably be obtained at the same institution and preferably by the same assessor)\n7. Patient able to understand and willing to give the informed consent and able to com-ply with the requirements of the study protocol.\n8. A woman of childbearing potential must have a negative highly sensitive serum (\u03b2-human chorionic gonadotropin \\[\u03b2-hCG\\]) at screening and urine \u03b2-hCG test at random-ization.\n9. Woman of child-bearing potential must agree to use adequate contraceptive methods that is highly effective (with a failure rate of \\<1% per year), with low user dependen-cy when used consistently and correctly, during the intervention period and for at least 7 months after the last dose of study intervention and agrees not to donate eggs (ova, oocytes) for the purpose of reproduction during the study and for a period of 7 months. The investigator should evaluate the effectiveness of the contraceptive meth-od in relationship to the first dose of study intervention.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n1. History of anticancer therapy for MBC, with the exception of single prior hormonal regimen for MBC, which must be stopped prior to randomization.\n\n   Note 1: Anticancer therapy for MBC includes any epidermal growth factor receptor or anti-HER2 agents or vaccines, cytotoxic chemotherapy, or more than one prior hormonal regimen for MBC Note 2: Single prior hormonal regimen for MBC may include more than one hormo-nal therapy. If a patient is switched to a different hormonal therapy because of dis-ease progression, this will be counted as two regimens, and the patient will not be eli-gible for the study. If a patient is switched to a different hormonal therapy for reasons other than disease progression (e.g., toxicity or local standard practice), this will be counted as single regimen.\n2. History of systemic breast cancer treatment in the neo-adjuvant or adjuvant setting with a disease-free interval from completion of the systemic treatment (excluding hormonal therapy) to metastatic diagnosis of \\< 12 months.\n3. History of approved or investigative tyrosine kinase/HER inhibitors for breast cancer in any treatment setting, except trastuzumab used in the neoadjuvant or adjuvant set-ting.\n4. Patients with CNS metastases, except for treated asymptomatic CNS metastases, pro-vided all of the following criteria are met:\n\n   1. Only supra-tentorial metastases allowed (i.e., no metastases to midbrain, pons, medulla, or spinal cord)\n   2. No evidence of interim progression or hemorrhage after completion of CNS-directed therapy\n   3. No ongoing requirement for corticosteroids as therapy for CNS disease (anti-convulsants at a stable dose are allowed)\n   4. No stereotactic radiation within 14 days or whole-brain radiation within 28 days prior to randomization\n   5. Leptomeningeal disease (i.e. carcinomatous meningitis)\n5.

History of myocardial infarction within 6 months before randomization.\n9. Current uncontrolled hypertension (systolic blood pressure \\>150 mmHg and/or dias-tolic blood pressure \\>100 mmHg), or unstable angina.\n10. Current dyspnea at rest due to complications of advanced malignancy or other diseas-es that require continuous oxygen therapy.\n11.
