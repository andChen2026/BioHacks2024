If test results for EGFR and ALK are not available, participants are required to undergo testing performed locally for these genomic alterations.\n* Participants must meet one of the required prior therapy requirements for advanced or metastatic NSCLC.\n\nFor the subset of participants with AGAs:\n\n- Documented positive test results for one or more actionable genomic alteration: EGFR, ALK, ROS1, METex14 skipping, RET or other AGAs with approved therapies\n\n- Received one or two prior lines of applicable targeted therapy for the participant's genomic alteration at the time of screening.\n\nAdditional Inclusion Criteria for Cohort 2 (TNBC)\n\n* Pathologically documented oestrogen and progesterone receptor-negative and HER2-negative expression.\n* Inoperable locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer.\n* Received at least 2 prior chemotherapy regimens for locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer and previously treated with a taxane in any setting.\n\nKey Exclusion Criteria:\n\n* Has leptomeningeal carcinomatosis or metastasis\n* Has clinically significant corneal disease\n* Has known active hepatitis or uncontrolled hepatitis B or C infection\n* Has a history of non-infectious ILD/pneumonitis that required steroids, has current ILD/pneumonitis, or where suspected ILD/pneumonitis cannot be ruled out by imaging at screening.\n* Prior exposure to specific therapies without an adequate treatment washout period prior to enrolment.\n\nAdditional Exclusion Criteria for Cohort 1 (NSCLC):\n\n- Has mixed SCLC and NSCLC histology.",
