The subject has participated in other clinical trials within 4 weeks or 5 half-lives (whichever is longer) before enrollment;\n3. The patient has previously received treatment including tyrosine kinase inhibitors targeting HER2 (e.g., lapatinib, neratinib, and pyrotinib);\n4. The patient has been diagnosed with other malignancies within 5 years of enrollment, except for cervical carcinoma in situ, basal cell carcinoma of the skin, or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin which has been cured;\n5.
