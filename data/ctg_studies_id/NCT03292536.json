Subjects with controlled brain metastasis (no radiographic progression at least 4 weeks following radiation and/or surgical treatment and no neurological signs or symptoms) will be allowed\n* History of allergy to merestinib or chemically related compounds\n* History of osteonecrosis of the jaw\n* Change in chemotherapy or hormone therapy within 8 weeks of the start of the study.\n* Active gout or inflammatory arthritis requiring treatment\n* Use within 28 days of registration of calcitonin, recombinant parathyroid hormone-related peptides, mithramycin, radium, strontium ranelate, or gallium nitrate.\n* Adult patients who require monitored anesthesia for PET scanning due to claustrophobia.",
