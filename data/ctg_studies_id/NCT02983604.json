    "eligibilityCriteria": "Key Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Histologically or cytologically confirmed breast cancer with evidence of metastatic or locally advanced disease not amenable to resection or radiation therapy with curative intent and who have progressed during treatment with at least one prior hormonal therapy\n\n  * Phase 1b Dose Escalation - Individuals may have had unlimited prior hormonal therapy and a total of 2 prior chemotherapy regimens (adjuvant chemotherapy is considered 1 regimen). Individuals may have progressed on fulvestrant or exemestane.\n  * Randomized Phase 2 Dose Expansion - Individuals may have disease progression during treatment or within 12 months of completion of endocrine therapy (tamoxifen, and/or AI) in the adjuvant setting, or disease progression during treatment with endocrine therapy (tamoxifen, AI or CDK4/6 inhibitor plus AI) for advanced/metastatic disease. Individuals may have had unlimited prior hormonal therapy, but must be naive to fulvestrant in the metastatic setting. A total of 2 prior chemotherapies are allowed, however, only one for metastatic disease is permitted.\n* Documentation of ER positive (\u2265 1% positive stained cells by local standards) based on the most recent tumor biopsy, unless bone-only disease\n* Documented HER2-negative tumor based on local testing on most recent tumor biopsy (immunohistochemistry score 0/1+ or negative by in situ hybridization HER2/CP17 ratio \\< 2 or for single probe assessment HER2 copy number \\< 4)\n* Post-, pre- or peri-menopausal women considered to be in the post-menopausal state as defined by one of the following:\n\n  * Age \u2265 60 years\n  * Age \\< 60 years and cessation of regular menses for at least 12 consecutive months in the absence of chemotherapy, tamoxifen, toremifene, or ovarian suppression and serum estradiol and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) level within the post-menopausal range\n  * Prior bilateral oophorectomy\n  * Pre-/peri-menopausal women can be enrolled if amenable to be treated with the luteinizing-hormone releasing hormone (LHRH) agonist, goserelin. Individuals must have commenced treatment with goserelin or an alternative LHRH agonist at least 4 weeks prior to Cycle 1 Day 1 (C1D1). If individuals have received an alternative LHRH agonist prior to study entry, they must switch to goserelin on or before Cycle 1 Day 1 (C1D1) for the duration of the study\n* Measurable disease defined per RECIST v. 1.1, or bone-only disease must have a lytic or mixed lytic blastic lesion that can be accurately assessed by computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).
