Concurrent anti-cancer therapy for current breast cancer (hormone therapy, chemotherapy, radiotherapy, immunotherapy). Patients already included in another therapeutic trial involving an experimental drug.\n2. Pregnant or lactating women.\n3. Any prior history of invasive breast cancer.\n4. Any previous history of non-breast malignancies (excepted basal cell carcinoma or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin) in the preceding 5 years.\n5. Known hypersensitivity to the study drug or excipients.\n6. Patients with other concurrent severe and/or uncontrolled medical disease or infection which could compromise participation in the study.\n7. Subjects unable to swallow oral medications.",
