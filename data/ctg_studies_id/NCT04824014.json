    "primaryOutcomeMeasure": "Correlation of 4FMFES-PET uptake with histopathological markers, notably ER immunohistochemistry (IHC) score",
    "eligibilityCriteria": "Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Advanced breast cancer patients, i.e. stage 3 or 4 diseases.\n* Aged 18 or older at the time of breast cancer diagnosis.\n* Histopathologic review confirming diagnosis of ER positive breast cancer.\n* Male patients, although rare, can participate.\n* Patient must have given informed consent.\n* ECOG performance status 0-3.\n* ER must be positive in at least 10% of tumor cells in either the core biopsy or a therapeutic surgical resection.\n* Any HER2-neu status.\n* Patient eligible for and willing to receive systemic treatment.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Patients who are pregnant or nursing.\n* Patients unable to tolerate PET/CT for 30 minutes.\n* Patients taking anti-ER hormone therapy that can pharmacologically blockade estrogen receptors (ex: Tamoxifen, Fulvestrant). Patients can undergo 4FMFES-PET if anti-ER therapy was interrupted at least 8 weeks prior imaging. Aromatase inhibitors and LHRH analogs are not expected to interfere with 4FMFES uptake and are thus permitted to be taken prior and during this study.",
