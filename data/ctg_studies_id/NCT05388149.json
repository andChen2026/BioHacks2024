Receiving adjuvant T-DM1, with evidence of MRD (positive test by Inivata RaDaR) after receiving 2-6 cycles of T-DM1\n3. No contraindications to T-DM1 or neratinib\n4. No clinical or radiographic evidence of recurrent or metastatic disease\n5. Previous Therapy requirements:\n\n   * Received 2-6 cycles of trastuzumab-DM1 in the adjuvant setting\n   * Received min of 12 weeks of endocrine therapy (ER+ patients)\n   * Adjuvant radiation permitted (minimum 14-day washout required)\n   * No prior neratinib or other HER2 tyrosine kinase inhibitor\n6.
