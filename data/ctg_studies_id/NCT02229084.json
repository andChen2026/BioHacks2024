Subjects with prior history at any time of any in situ cancer, including lobular carcinoma of the breast in situ, cervical cancer in situ, atypical melanocytic hyperplasia or Clark I melanoma in situ or basal or squamous skin cancer are eligible, provided they are disease-free at the time of registration. Subjects with other malignancies are eligible if they have been continuously disease free for \u2265 5 years prior to the time of registration.\n* Active autoimmune disorders or conditions of immunosuppression; Existing diagnosis or history of autoimmune disorders or conditions of immunosuppression that have been in remission for less than 6 months\n* Treatment with corticosteroids, including oral steroids (i.e. prednisone, dexamethasone \\[except when used as an antiemetic in SoC therapy\\]), continuous use of topical steroid creams or ointments or any steroid-containing inhalers. Subjects who discontinue the use of these classes of medication for at least 6 weeks prior to registration are eligible if, in the judgment of the treating physician, the subject is not likely to require these classes of drugs during the treatment period. Replacement doses of steroids for subjects with adrenal insufficiency are allowed.\n* Pregnancy or breastfeeding (due to the unknown effects of peptide/mimotope vaccines on a fetus or infant). Women of childbearing potential must have a negative urine pregnancy test within 72 hours prior to starting week 1 and must be counseled to use an accepted and effective method of contraception (including abstinence) while on treatment and for a period of 18 months after completing or discontinuing treatment. Accepted methods of contraception include tubal ligation, oral contraceptives, barrier methods, IUDs, and abstinence.\n* Any other significant medical or psychiatric conditions, which, in the opinion of the enrolling investigator, may interfere with consent or compliance of the treatment regimen.\n* Enrollment in any other clinical trial using investigational drug products or devices prior to first post-surgery study lab. Concurrent enrollment in observational studies is allowed.",
