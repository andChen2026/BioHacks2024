Exceptions include basal cell carcinoma of the skin, squamous cell carcinoma of the skin, or in situ cervical cancer that has undergone potentially curative therapy.\n* Any condition that confounds the ability to interpret data from the study.\n* Symptomatic central nervous system metastases. Subjects with brain metastases that have been previously treated and are stable for 6 weeks are allowed.\n* Persistent diarrhea or malabsorption \u2265 NCI CTCAE grade 2, despite medical management.\n* Unstable angina, significant cardiac arrhythmia, or New York Heart Association (NYHA) class 3 or 4 congestive heart failure.\n* Prior systemic cancer-directed treatments or investigational modalities \u2264 5 half-lives or 4 weeks, whichever is shorter, prior to starting study drug or who have not recovered from side effects of such therapy (except alopecia).\n* Has an active auto-immune disease requiring systemic treatment within the past 3 months or a documented history of clinically severe autoimmune disease, or a syndrome that requires systemic steroids or immunosuppressive agents. Subjects with vitiligo or resolved childhood asthma/atopy would be an exception to this rule. Subjects that require intermittent use of bronchodilators or local steroid injections would not be excluded from the study. Subjects with hypothyroidism stable on hormone replacement or Sjorgen's syndrome will not be excluded from the study.\n* Has evidence of interstitial lung disease or active, non-infectious pneumonitis.\n* Has an active infection requiring systemic therapy.\n* Has a history or current evidence of any condition, therapy, or laboratory abnormality that might confound the results of the trial, interfere with the subject's participation for the full duration of the trial, or is not in the best interest of the subject to participate, in the opinion of the treating investigator.\n* Has known psychiatric or substance abuse disorders that would interfere with cooperation with the requirements of the trial.\n* Is pregnant or breastfeeding, or expecting to conceive or father children within the projected duration of the trial, starting with the pre-screening or screening visit through 120 days after the last dose of trial treatment.\n* Active and ongoing steroid use, except for non-systemically absorbed treatments (such as inhaled or topical steroid therapy for asthma, Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD), allergic rhinitis).\n* Major surgery \u2264 2 weeks prior to starting a study drug or who have not recovered from side effects of such therapy.\n* Pregnant or breast feeding.\n* Known Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infection and/or Hepatitis B or C positive.\n* Known hypersensitivity to pembrolizumab or any of its excipients.\n* Has received a live vaccine within 30 days prior to the first dose of trial treatment.\n* Patients receiving medications or substances that are strong inhibitors or inducers of CYP450 enzyme(s) are ineligible.\n* Pregnant women are excluded from this study because vorinostat, tamoxifen and PD-1 are drug classes with the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated with vorinostat, tamoxifen and PD-1 inhibitors.",
