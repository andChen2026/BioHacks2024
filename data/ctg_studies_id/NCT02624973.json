    "eligibilityCriteria": "Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Previously untreated, histologically confirmed non-inflammatory breast cancer, \\>4 cm in diameter and /or metastatic ipsilateral axillary deposits for which the smallest diameter of the largest node \\>2 cm by CT or ultrasound scan.\n* WHO performance status 0-1\n* Known tumor ER, PGR, HER2 and TP53 status.\n* Known tumor Ki67 percentage (if ER/PGR\\>50% and TP53 wt status).\n* Distant metastasis not suspected. Patients will undergo radiology exams during screening phase, after signing the informed consent.\n* Age \\>18 years\n* Patients must have clinically and/or radiographically documented measurable breast cancer according to RECIST.\n* Radiology studies (CT thorax/abdomen and bone scintigraphy/bone scan) must be performed within 28 days prior to registration.\n* Absence of any psychological, familial, sociological or geographical condition potentially hampering compliance with the study protocol and follow-up schedule; those conditions should be discussed with the patient before registration in the trial\n* Before patient registration/randomization, written informed consent must be given according to national and local regulations.\n* For arms B-H:\n\n  * Neutrophils \\> 1.5 x 109/L\n  * Platelets \\> 100 x 109/L\n  * Bilirubin \\< 2 x upper limit normal (ULN).
