Patients who are receiving peri-procedural short-acting analgesics will still be included as long as they are no longer receiving analgesics by D1 of chemotherapy.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* A history of (within one month) or current pregabalin use.\n* Baseline pain scores \u22657 as measured via 10-point numerical scale for pain (see section 11.1).\n* Unwilling to discontinue use of antihistamines from 7 days prior to D1 of study medication.\n* Creatinine clearance (CrCl) \u226460 ml/min (as measured via Cockcroft-Gault) based on serum creatinine measured as part of standard of care prior to administration of chemotherapy\n* Women of childbearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test prior to initiating therapy (note, this test should be standard of care prior to administration of chemotherapy).\n* Patient is unable or unwilling to abide by the study protocol or cooperate fully with the investigator.\n* Eligible and agrees to enroll into therapeutic trial ongoing at the Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center (LCCC) (i.e., the treatment trial will take precedence over LCCC1314).\n* Currently receiving therapeutic doses of anticoagulants (ie, prophylactic use of anticoagulants is allowed) due to possibility of dizziness and falls while on pregabalin.\n* Currently receiving aromatase inhibitors or agents targeted against Ph+ leukemias (i.e., imatinib, dasatinib, nilotinib, and ponatinib) or scheduled to start these drugs during cycle 1 of scheduled chemotherapy.\n* Presence of bone metastases.\n* History of angioedema.\n* History of a seizure disorder.",
