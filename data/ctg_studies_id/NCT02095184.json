Postmenopausal status, defined by no menstrual cycle for 12 months or surgical removal of ovaries.\n3. Histologically confirmed adenocarcinoma of the breast.\n4. Evidence of hormone sensitive, ER rich primary tumor defined by an Allred score of \u22656.\n5. Human estrogen receptor -2 (HER2) negative in the primary tumor tissue as defined by:\n\n   1. Grade 0 or 1+ staining intensity (on a scale of 0 to 3) by means of IHC analysis OR\n   2. Grade 2+ staining intensity by means of immuno-histochemical (IHC) analysis with gene amplification on fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) \\< 2.0 OR\n   3. Gene amplification on fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) \\< 2.0.\n6. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status \u2264 3\n7.

Patients may not be receiving any other investigational agent.\n3. History of allergic reactions or hypersensitivity to compounds of similar chemical or biologic composition to anastrozole or letrozole.",
