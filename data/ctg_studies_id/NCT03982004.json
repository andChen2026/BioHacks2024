Pregnancy test will be repeated on day 1 prior to initiation of study treatment.\n\n  * A male participant must agree to use contraception during the treatment period and for at least 120 days after the last dose of study treatment and refrain from donating sperm during this period.\n  * Ability to understand and willingness to sign an IRB approved written informed consent document.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Has large, ulcerated, bulky tumors (defined as total volume greater than 4 x 4 x 4 cm\\^3 with \\> 50% ulceration).\n* Has life expectancy of \\< 6 months.\n* Prior treatment with the following:\n\n  * Any anti-PD-1, anti-PD-L1, or anti-PD-L2 agent or with an agent directed to another stimulatory or co-inhibitory T-cell receptor (e.g. CTLA-4, OX-40, CD137).\n  * Radiotherapy within 2 weeks of start of study treatment. A 1-week washout is permitted for palliative radiation (\u2264 2 weeks of radiotherapy) to non-CNS disease.\n  * Investigational agents or devices within 4 weeks prior to anticipated study treatment start date Note: Participants must have recovered from all AEs due to a previous therapies to \u2264 grade 1 or baseline. Subjects with \u2264 Grade 2 neuropathy are eligible if per treating physician the neuropathy symptoms are stable. Patients must have completed any corticosteroids for treatment-related toxicities. Patients who developed radiation pneumonitis are not eligible.\n\nNote: If subject had recent surgery, they must have recovered adequately from the toxicity and/or complications from the intervention in the opinion of the treating investigator prior to starting therapy\n\n* Has severe hypersensitivity (\u2265 grade 3) to pembrolizumab or any of its excipients.\n* Has a known additional malignancy that is progressing or requires active treatment within the past 3 years.
