    "eligibilityCriteria": "Inclusion Criteria:\n\n1. \u2265 18-year-old females\n2. Histologically or cytologically documented invasive breast cancer\n3. Documented progressive disease (Phase 1b study) OR documented metastatic disease (Phase 2a study)\n4. Prior Treatment:\n\n   * Phase 1b study: No more than 4 prior chemotherapy treatments, only 1 prior taxane-based regimen for metastatic disease. There is no limit to the number of prior hormonal or biological treatments.\n   * Phaes 2a study: No prior chemotherapy or biological therapy for metastatic breast cancer. There is no limit to the number of prior hormonal treatments.\n   * Prior adjuvant chemotherapy or biological therapy will not be counted in the number of prior treatments, unless recurrence occurs within 12 months of last dose of adjuvant therapy, in which case it will be counted as 1 prior therapy; adjuvant treatment with a taxane is allowed.\n5. Measurable or evaluable disease by RECIST criteria (Phase 1b study) (see Appendix A). Subjects to be enrolled in the Phase 2a study are required to have measureable disease according to RECIST.\n6. No prior VEGF-TKI drugs such as sunitinib, sorafenib, AZ2171, AG013736, GW786034, ZD6474 AMG706, PTK/ZK and other similar agents.\n7. No treatment with bevacizumab within 4 weeks prior to start of protocol therapy, no prior treatment with other VEGF binding antibodies or VEGF-trap.\n8. No treatment with the following agents within 3 weeks prior to start of protocol therapy:\n\n   * Chemotherapy (at least 6 weeks for nitrosoureas, mitomycin C, and liposomal doxorubicin)\n   * Other signal transduction inhibitors and monoclonal antibodies\n   * Immunotherapy or biological response modifiers\n   * Any experimental therapy\n9. No treatment with radiotherapy within 2 weeks (if involving \\< 25% of bone marrow), or 4 weeks (if involving \u2265 25% of bone marrow) prior to start of protocol therapy.\n10. Resolution of all toxicities\n11. ECOG performance status \u2264 2 and life expectancy \u2265 3 months.\n12. Signed and dated written informed consent\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n1.

Effective barrier methods are male or female condoms, diaphragms, and spermicides (creams or gels that contain a chemical to kill sperm.) Oral, implantable, or injectable contraceptives may be affected by cytochrome P450 interactions, and are not considered effective for this study.\n3. Subjects with symptomatic CNS metastases. Subjects with treated brain metastases that have remained stable for at least 3 months without steroids are allowed. Subjects with signs or symptoms or history of brain metastasis must have a CT or MRI scan of the brain within 1 month prior to the start of protocol therapy.
