(The use of aromatase inhibitors or ovarian suppression is permitted given that they do not block estrogen receptors).\n* Pregnancy or lactation or parturient or nursing mother\n* Patient presents with any other clinically active, serious, life-threatening disease, medical, or psychiatric condition, and/or who has a life expectancy of \\<12 months, or for whom study participation may compromise their management; and/or a patient who the investigator judges to be unsuitable for participation in the study for any reason.",
