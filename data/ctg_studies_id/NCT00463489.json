Non-insulin requiring diabetics are eligible for the study.\n* Serious digestive and/or absorptive problems, including inflammatory bowel disease and chronic diarrhea that preclude adherence to the study diet.\n* Cardiovascular, respiratory or musculoskeletal disease or joint problems that preclude moderate physical activity. Moderate arthritis that does not preclude physical activity is not a reason for ineligibility.\n* Psychiatric disorders or conditions that, in the opinion of the investigator, would preclude participation in the study intervention (e.g. untreated major depression or psychosis, substance abuse, severe personality disorder).\n* Patients on aromatase inhibitors other than letrozole at study entry.\n* Known recurrence of breast cancer (local, regional or distant) at any time prior to study entry.\n* History of other malignancies except: adequately treated non-melanoma skin cancer, curatively treated in situ carcinoma of the cervix, or other solid tumours curatively treated with no evidence of disease for \u2265 5 years. Prior in situ cancer of the breast is not a reason for exclusion.\n* Patients not fluent in either English or French (spoken and written).\n* Patient unwilling or unable to provide informed consent.",
