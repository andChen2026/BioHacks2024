This criterion will be assessed via the Physical Activity Vital Signs (PAVS) questionnaire, which asks the following two questions: 1) \"Please describe your level of physical activity, \\[first by\\] minutes per day, \\[followed by\\] number of days each week\", and 2) \"At what intensity (how hard): light (like a casual walk), moderate (like a brisk walk), or vigorous (like a jog/run)?\" (Ball et al., 2016). The questionnaire is scored by multiplying the days by minutes of physical activity to create an estimate of minutes per week of at least moderate-to-vigorous physical activity.\n* Symptoms of long-covid/post covid syndrome",
