Female participants must be 1 year post-menopausal, surgically sterile, or using one highly effective form of birth control (a highly effective method of contraception is defined as one that can achieve a failure rate of less than 1% per year when used consistently and correctly). Women of childbearing potential who are sexually active with a non-sterilised male partner must agree to use one highly effective method of birth control from the time of screening and must agree to continue using such precautions for 7 months after the last dose of study treatment (see Table 4 for complete list of highly effective birth control methods). Female patients must refrain from egg cell donation and breastfeeding while on study and for 7 months after the last dose of study treatments. Non sterilised male partners of a woman of childbearing potential must use a male condom plus spermicide (condom alone in countries where spermicides are not approved) throughout this period. Not engaging in heterosexual activity (sexual abstinence) for the duration of the study and drug washout period is an acceptable practice if this is the preferred usual lifestyle of the participant; however, periodic or occasional abstinence, the rhythm method, and the withdrawal method are not acceptable methods of contraception.\n15. Male participants who intend to be sexually active with a female partner of childbearing potential must be surgically sterile or using an acceptable method of contraception (see Table 4) from the time of screening throughout the total duration of the study and the drug washout period (4 months after the last dose of study treatment) to prevent pregnancy in a partner. Male participants must not donate or bank sperm during this same time period. Not engaging in heterosexual activity (sexual abstinence) for the duration of the study and drug washout period is an acceptable practice if this is the preferred usual lifestyle of the participant; however, periodic or occasional abstinence, the rhythm method, and the withdrawal method are not acceptable methods of contraception.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n1. Ineligible for any of the agents on the study. Participants with contraindications to pyrotinib per local prescribing information or to T-DXd per the T-DXd Investigator's Brochure cannot be enrolled to the study.\n2.

Participants with clinically inactive brain metastases may be included in the study. Participants with treated brain metastases that are no longer symptomatic and who require no treatment with corticosteroids or anticonvulsants may be included in the study if they have recovered from the acute toxic effect of radiotherapy.

History of (non-infectious) interstitial lung disease(ILD)/pneumonitis that required steroids, has current ILD/pneumonitis, or where suspected ILD/pneumonitis cannot be ruled out by imaging at screening.\n15. Lung criteria:\n\n    1. Lung-specific intercurrent clinically significant illnesses including, but not limited to, any underlying pulmonary disorder (eg, pulmonary emboli within 3 months of study enrolment, severe asthma, severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder (COPD), restrictive lung disease, pleural effusion, post Corona Virus Disease 2019 pulmonary fibrosis, etc,).\n    2. Any autoimmune, connective tissue or inflammatory disorders (eg, rheumatoid arthritis, Sjogren's, sarcoidosis, etc.) where there is documented, or a suspicion of pulmonary involvement at the time of screening.
