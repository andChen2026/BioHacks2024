Women of child-bearing age will undergo a urine pregnancy test on the day of surgery, which is standard of care prior to anesthesia.\n* Breastfeeding: It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when indocyanine green is administered to a nursing woman. Study team will exclude women who are breastfeeding.\n* Unable to provide informed consent\n* Allergy to indocyanine green\n* History of ipsilateral breast or axillary surgery",
