    "eligibilityCriteria": "* INCLUSION CRITERIA:\n\nPostmenopausal female.\n\nPostmenopausal defined as no menses for at least 12 months or bilateral oophorectomy. In unclear cases, (e.g. 50 year old who has had hysterectomy) chemical confirmation of postmenopausal status may be confirmed with follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) greater than 35 U/L.\n\nElevated risk for developing invasive breast cancer by virtue of one of the following criteria:\n\nGail Model risk of greater than or equal to 1.7% over 5 years from study entry. (This is the same minimum level of risk required for a subject to be eligible for the recently completed NSABP-P1 tamoxifen breast cancer prevention trial).\n\nLobular neoplasia.\n\nAtypical ductal hyperplasia.\n\nDCIS (ductal carcinoma in situ) that has been previously treated with mastectomy or lumpectomy and radiation, +/- tamoxifen.\n\nDeleterious mutations in BRCA1 or 2 OR A priori risk assessment of 20% chance or greater of carrying BRCA1/2 gene mutation. The BRCAPRO and Couch model will both be used to asses this risk. If a woman has a 20% risk of carrying a BRCA1/2 mutation by either model, she will meet eligibility criteria.\n\nPrior stage I or II breast cancer at least 2 years out from treatment for invasive disease and no prior use of aromatase inhibitors.\n\nSubjects should be willing to abstain from use of hormonal therapies (e.g. tamoxifen, hormone replacement therapy, oral contraceptive pills, hormone-containing intrauterine devices (IUDs). E-string is acceptable). Venlafaxine will be offered as supportive care for women with menopausal symptoms.\n\nEastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 0-1.\n\nSubject has been counseled regarding her options and has signed the informed consent document.\n\nBaseline dual-emission x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) scan with bone mineral density (BMD) T-score greater than or equal to 2.5 at antero posterior (AP) spine.\n\nHemoglobin greater than or equal to 11 g/dl.\n\nCreatinine less than 1.5 times the upper limits of normal.\n\nAlanine aminotransferase (ALT) or aspartate aminotransferase (AST) less than 2.5 times upper limit of normal.\n\nNo investigational agent for the past 30 days.\n\nIf history of cancer (other than squamous or basal cell skin cancers), subject must have no evidence of disease at time of enrollment AND no history of cancer directed treatment in the 2 years preceding enrollment.\n\nEXCLUSION CRITERIA:\n\nCurrent or recent chronic use (within 3 months) of hormonal medications, e.g. oral contraceptive pills, hormone replacement therapy, tamoxifen, raloxifene, IUD with progestins or corticosteroids. (Subjects on chronic topical or inhaled steroids will be eligible for the study.) Current use of phenytoin, carbamazepine, rifampin due to increased estrogen metabolism.\n\nHistory of clotting or bleeding disorder.\n\nHistory of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic composition to exemestane (e.g. anastrozole, letrozole, formestane).\n\nUncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements.",
