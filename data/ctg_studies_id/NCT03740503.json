The exact definition of this is adaptable to the disease but a suggested guideline is a Complete Response, Partial Response or progression free interval of at least 6 months\n   2. Exceptionally poor response includes patients who were expected to respond favourably to a treatment but instead responded poorly (e.g dramatic tumor growth or death)\n2. The patient must have sufficient archival tumor available for sequencing.\n3. Deceased patients will also be considered for analysis (up to 30 patients per year) if they meet at least one of the following requirements:\n\n   a)) Patients who have archival tissue stored within the UHN Laboratory Medicine Program who have had a consent waiver granted by the REB to access the tissue.\n\n   b) Patients who have archival tissue banked for further research within the UHN Biospecimen Sciences Program\n\n   Exclusion Criteria:\n   * None",
