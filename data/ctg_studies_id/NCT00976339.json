Premenopausal women who need to take calcium supplementation for any medical condition will be excluded from the study. Dietary restrictions on calcium intake may be imposed if the subject is found to have borderline high serum or urine levels of calcium during the study intervention and a list of dietary sources of calcium will be provided.\n* Normal serum calcium.\n* No history of kidney stones.\n* Adequate renal and hepatic function: serum creatinine, bilirubin, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine transaminase (ALT) and alkaline phosphatase \\< 2.0 x the institutional upper limit of normal (IULN).\n* No hypersensitivity reactions to vitamin D.\n* Performance status of 0 or 1.\n* Not pregnant or nursing.\n* Agree to use effective contraception, hormone-based oral contraceptives allowed but switching birth control methods is discouraged while on-study.\n* No significant medical or psychiatric condition that would preclude study completion.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Not meeting one or any of inclusion criteria",
