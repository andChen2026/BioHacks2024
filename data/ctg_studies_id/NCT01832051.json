In the Netherlands HER2-positivity is defined as:\n\n   * HER2 immunohistochemical score of 3+, or\n   * HER2 immunohistochemical score of 2+ and positive FISH for HER2/c-erbB2 amplification.\n\n   In Belgium HER2-positivity is defined as positive FISH for HER2/c-erbB2 amplification.\n2. Patients with suspected metastatic disease or local recurrence of HER2-positive breast cancer and a clinical dilemma:\n\n   * in whom standard work up with imaging has failed to solve the clinical dilemma (diagnostic/therapeutic), leaving issues with regard to HER2 status of lesions and\n   * in whom a biopsy is desirable but cannot (easily) be performed due to technical or patient factors or otherwise.\n3. Standard work-up with imaging is defined as CT chest and abdomen, bone scintigraphy, as well as FDG-PET.\n4. Age \\>18 years of age.\n5. WHO performance status 0-2.\n6.
