Postmenopausal women must be amenorrheic for at least 12 months to be considered of non-childbearing potential.\n* Final eligibility for a clinical trial is determined by the health professionals conducting the trial.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Evidence of disease outside the breast or chest wall, except ipsilateral axillary lymph nodes.\n* Prior chemotherapy, hormonal therapy, biologic therapy or radiation therapy for breast cancer. Patients with history of DCIS are eligible if they were treated with surgery alone.\n* Medical, psychological, or surgical condition which the investigator feels might compromise study participation.\n* Pregnant or lactating women are not eligible.\n* Patients with history of previous or current malignancy at other sites with the exception of adequately treated carcinoma in situ of the cervix or basal or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin. Patients with a history of other malignancies who remain disease free for greater than five years are eligible.\n* Evidence of sensory and/or peripheral neuropathy.\n* Serious, uncontrolled, concurrent infections.\n* Major surgery within 4 weeks of the start of study treatment without complete recovery.\n* Final eligibility for a clinical trial is determined by the health professionals conducting the trial.",
