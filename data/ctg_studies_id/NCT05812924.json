Patients not currently using endocrine therapy will also be eligible for participation since patients more than 5 or 10 years from diagnosis (and therefore having completed adjuvant endocrine therapy) may be enrolled.\n* Some patients with triple negative breast cancer who receive chemotherapy also experience GSM related to ovarian function decline outside of the setting of ovarian suppression, and therefore patients with either ER+ or ER- breast cancer will be allowed to participate.\n* Patients must provide written informed consent for participation in this study.\n* Patients are allowed to have used non-hormonal moisturizers but if they have previously used hormonal moisturizers, they will be asked to stop the use for one month prior to the first planned treatment, termed the \"washout period\", if needed.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Patients with any systemic or topical hormone replacement therapy within 3 months prior to enrollment, known genital infection, coagulation disorders, or on anticoagulant therapy or turmeric-containing supplements within the prior 2 weeks will be excluded.\n* Women who are pregnant or who plan to become pregnant within the following six months will be excluded since the impact of recent PRP injections to the vulva and the impact on obstetric injury during vaginal delivery has not been studied.",
