Patients who underwent significant surgical procedures, other than diagnostic surgeries, within 4 weeks prior to the start of the study treatment, or are expected to require significant surgical procedures during the study period.\n* 10. Patients who had malignant tumors other than breast cancer within the last 5 years, except for malignancies in the study that have negligible risks of metastasis or death (e.g., a 5-year overall survival rate \\> 90%), such as adequately treated cervical carcinoma in situ, non-melanoma skin cancer, ductal carcinoma in situ, or stage I uterine cancer.\n* 11. Patients who experienced severe infections within 4 weeks prior to the start of the study treatment, including but not limited to those requiring hospitalization due to infections, bacteremia, severe pneumonia, or any active infection that may impact patient safety.\n* 12. Patients who have previously received allogeneic stem cell or solid organ transplants.\n* 13. Any other diseases, metabolic dysfunctions, physical examination abnormalities, or clinical laboratory abnormalities that contraindicate the use of the study drug, may affect the interpretation of results, or pose a high risk of treatment complications for the patient.",
