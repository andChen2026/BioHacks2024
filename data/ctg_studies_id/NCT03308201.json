Objective evidence shows that patients with metastasis or relapse who cannot be cured by standard treatment;\n3. ER positive (\u22651%) and HER2 over-expression (immunohistochemical IHC test 3+ and/or in situ hybridization ISH test positive), Post-menopausal female subjects who are suitable for exemestane as endocrine therapy ; Remarks: The expansion period is planned to include 6 subjects combined with letrozole and 6 subjects combined with fulvestrant in the 400mg dose group. Therefore, for this part of the subjects, the expansion period is included \" Post-menopausal female subjects who are suitable for letrozole or fulvestrant as endocrine therapy\";\n4. Postmenopausal is defined as meeting any one of the following four conditions:\n\n   * Past bilateral oophorectomy;\n   * Age \u226560 years old;\n   * Age \\<60 years old, natural menopause \u226512 months, in the past 1 year without chemotherapy, tamoxifen, toremifene or ovarian castration, the level of follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) and estradiol Within the postmenopausal range (use the reference range of the local laboratory).\n   * Patients younger than 60 years old who are taking tamoxifen or toremifene, their FSH and estradiol levels are within the postmenopausal range (use the reference range of the local laboratory); Remarks: Premenopausal or perimenopausal women who do not meet the above-mentioned menopausal criteria can also be included in this study, but they must also receive zoladex ovarian suppression therapy. Ovarian suppression therapy has been started at least 14 days before the start of this program, and Must be continued during the treatment plan; For subjects whose postmenopausal status is difficult to judge, the investigator and medical personnel of the sponsor will determine whether to enter the group after discussion.\n5.
