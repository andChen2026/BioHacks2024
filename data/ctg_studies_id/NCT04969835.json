Adequate haematological function (applies only to patients not receiving therapeutic anticoagulation; patients receiving therapeutic anticoagulation should be on a stable dose):\n\n   1.

Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) \\<5 \u00d7 ULN (patients with documented liver or bone metastases only)\n10. Adequate renal function:\n\n    a. Serum creatinine \u22641.5 \u00d7 ULN (in patients for whom, in the Investigator's judgment, serum creatinine levels do not adequately reflect renal function, creatinine clearance by Cockcroft-Gale formula \u2265 50 mL/min may be used)\n11.

Contraception requirements:\n\n    1. Female patients of childbearing potential must agree to remain abstinent (refrain from heterosexual intercourse) or use a highly effective contraceptive method (Pearl Index failure rate \\<1% per year) during the treatment period and for at least 6 months after the last dose of study drug\n    2. Male patients with female partners of childbearing potential must agree to use 2 acceptable methods of contraception (Pearl Index failure rate \\<1% per year), including a barrier method (with or without spermicide) during the treatment period and for at least 6 months after the last dose of study drug\n\nKey Exclusion Criteria:\n\n1.
