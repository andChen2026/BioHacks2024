If the patient has had previous radiation to the marker lesion(s), there must be evidence of disease progression since the radiation\n* Adequate bone marrow function as shown by: Absolute Neutrophil Count (ANC) \u2265 1.5 x 109/L, Platelets (PLT)\u2265 100 x 109/L, Hemoglobin (HGB) \u22659 g/dL\n* Adequate liver function as shown by:Serum bilirubin \u2264 1.5 x upper limits of normal (ULN), Prothrombin Time (INR) \u2264 1.3 (or \u2264 3 on anticoagulants), Liver function teats \u2264 2.5x ULN (\u2264 5x ULN in patients with liver metastases)\n* Adequate renal function: serum creatinine \u2264 1.5 x ULN\n* Controlled diabetes as defined by fasting serum glucose \u22641.5 x ULN\n* Fasting serum cholesterol \u2264300 mg/dL or \u22647.75 mmol/L AND fasting triglycerides \u2264 2.5 x ULN.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Currently receiving anticancer therapies or who have received anticancer therapies within 4 weeks of the start of study drug (including chemotherapy, antibody based therapy, etc.)\n* Palliative radiation therapy only allowed to localized areas (ie: painful rib lesion), at the discretion of the PI and treating radiation oncologist\n* Major surgery/significant traumatic injury within 4 weeks of start of study drug.\n* Not recovered from the side effects of any major surgery (defined as requiring general anesthesia) to Grade I or patients that may require major surgery during the course of the study.\n* Prior treatment with any investigational drug within the preceding 4 weeks\n* Receiving chronic immunosuppressive agents, except corticosteroids with a daily dosage equivalent to prednisone \u2264 20 milligrams (mg). However, patients receiving corticosteroids must have been on a stable dosage regimen for a minimum of 4 weeks prior to the first treatment with RAD001. Topical or inhaled corticosteroids are allowed.\n* May not receive immunization with attenuated live vaccines within one week of study entry or during study period.\n* Uncontrolled brain or leptomeningeal metastases, including patients who continue to require glucocorticoids for brain or leptomeningeal metastases\n* Other malignancies within the past 3 years, except for adequately treated carcinoma of the cervix and basal or squamous cell carcinomas of the skin.\n* Severe and/or uncontrolled medical conditions or other conditions that could affect their participation in the study such as: Congestive heart failure: New York Heart Association Class III/IV, Unstable angina pectoris, symptomatic congestive heart failure, myocardial infarction within 6 months of start of study drug, serious uncontrolled cardiac arrhythmia or any other clinically significant cardiac disease.\n* Impaired lung function (PFT screen at baseline) as defined as spirometry and DLCO that is 50% of the normal predicted value and/or 02 saturation that is 88% or less at rest on room air.\n* Uncontrolled diabetes as defined by fasting serum glucose \u22651.5 x ULN. Glucose control should be achieved before starting a patient on RAD001.\n* Active (acute or chronic) or uncontrolled severe infections\n* Liver disease(cirrhosis, chronic active hepatitis or chronic persistent hepatitis)\n* Known history of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) seropositivity\n* Impairment of gastrointestinal function/disease that may significantly alter the absorption of RAD001 (e.g., ulcerative disease, uncontrolled nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, malabsorption syndrome or small bowel resection)\n* Active, bleeding diathesis\n* Female patients who are pregnant or breast feeding, or adults of reproductive potential who are not using effective birth control methods.\n* Prior treatment with an mTOR inhibitor (sirolimus, temsirolimus, everolimus).\n* Known hypersensitivity to RAD001 (everolimus) or other rapamycin drugs (sirolimus, temsirolimus) or to its excipients",
