All women of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test obtained within 72 hours before starting therapy\n10. Patients with reproductive potential must use effective contraception (hormone or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry, for the duration of study participation, and for 2 months after the completion of therapy\n11. Patients (or a surrogate) must be able to comply with study procedures and sign informed consent\n\nExclusion criteria:\n\n1. Prior therapy with bevacizumab, sorafenib, sunitinib, or other VEGF pathway-targeted therapy\n2. Patients whose CNS metastasis progressed or developed during prior cisplatin treatment\n3. History or evidence of inherited bleeding diathesis or coagulopathy with the risk of bleeding\n4. History of thrombotic disorders\n5. Active gastrointestinal bleeding\n6. Patients with a history of self-reported intra-cranial hemorrhage\n7. Patients with clinical signs or symptoms of gastrointestinal obstruction and who require parenteral hydration and/or nutrition because of obstruction\n8. History of abdominal fistula, gastrointestinal perforation, or intra-abdominal abscess within 6 months of first dose of bevacizumab\n9. Clinically significant peripheral artery disease\n10. Arterial thromboembolic event within the past 6 months, including transient ischemic attack, cerebrovascular accident, unstable angina, or myocardial infarction\n11. History of gross hemoptysis (i.e. \u2265 1 teaspoon of bright red blood)\n12.
