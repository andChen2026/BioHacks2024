    "eligibilityCriteria": "Key Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* On an antiretroviral therapy (ART) regimen for at least 6 consecutive months, with no change in the ART regimen within 2 months prior to screening. Permitted ARTs are as follows:\n\n  * Cohort 1: A regimen of (BIC, DTG, RAL, or DOR) plus Nucleoside Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors (NRTIs). Examples of acceptable regimens include BIC/emtricitabine/tenofovir, DTG/ABC/3TC, DTG/3TC, DTG + emtricitabine/tenofovir, or DOR/3TC/tenofovir\n  * Cohort 2: A DTG-based regimen is required (DTG/ABC/3TC), (DTG/3TC), or (DTG + NRTIs)\n* Plasma HIV-1 RNA levels less than 50 copies/mL at screening\n* Have normal hematologic function with an absolute neutrophil count greater than or equal to 1.5 \u00d7 10\\^9/L, platelets greater than or equal to 150 \u00d7 10\\^9/L; hemoglobin greater than or equal to 10.5 g/dL for females and greater than or equal to 11.5 g/dL for males\n* Clusters of differentiation (CD) 4 T cell count greater than or equal to 350 cells/\u03bcL\n* Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) less than or equal to 2.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN) and total bilirubin less than or equal to 1.5 mg/dL, or normal direct bilirubin and creatinine less than or equal to 1.25 x ULN\n* Have a calculated creatinine clearance (CLcr) of at least 60 mL/min (using the Cockcroft-Gault method) based on serum creatinine and actual body weight as measured at screening and upon admission\n* Individuals assigned female at birth and of childbearing potential who engage in heterosexual intercourse must agree to use protocol-specified method(s) of contraception\n* Must be willing and able to comply with all study requirements and available to complete the study schedule of assessments\n* In the judgment of the investigator, be in good general health, based on review of the results from a screening visit\n\nKey Exclusion Criteria:\n\n* Have received any study drug within 30 days prior to study dosing\n* Participation in any other clinical study (including observation studies) without prior approval from the sponsor is prohibited while participating in this study\n* Have current alcohol or substance abuse judged by the investigator to potentially interfere with individual compliance or individual safety, or a positive drug or alcohol test at screening or baseline\n* No Evidence of chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection (defined as positive hepatitis B surface antigen \\[HBsAg\\] and/or positive HBV core antibody with positive reflex HBV DNA polymerase chain reaction (PCR)). Note: positive HBV core antibody with negative reflex HBV DNA PCR results are acceptable\n* No Evidence of active hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection (defined as positive hepatitis C antibody and HCV RNA above lower limit of quantitation). Note: positive anti-HCV antibody and negative HCV PCR results are acceptable\n* Acute febrile illness within 35 days prior to Day 1\n* Have been treated with systemic steroids, immunosuppressant therapies, or chemotherapeutic agents within 3 months prior to screening or is expected to receive these agents during the study\n* Received any vaccine or immunomodulatory medication within 4 weeks prior to screening. Elective vaccination (eg, flu shot, hepatitis A or B vaccine) during the course of the study will require prior approval from the sponsor\n\n  * Coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) vaccinations are allowed, with the requirement that they should not be administered within 7 \u00b1 2 days of receiving VES\n* Have a history of any of the following:\n\n  * Significant serious skin disease, such as but not limited to rash, food allergy, eczema, psoriasis, or urticaria\n  * Significant drug sensitivity or drug allergy (such as anaphylaxis or hepatoxicity)\n  * Known hypersensitivity to the study drugs, their metabolites, or to formulation excipients\n  * Autoimmune disease\n  * Significant cardiac disease or a family history of long QT syndrome, or unexplained death in an otherwise healthy individual between the ages of 1 and 30 years\n  * Syncope, palpitations, or unexplained dizziness\n  * Implanted defibrillator or pacemaker\n  * Liver disease, including Gilbert syndrome\n  * Severe peptic ulcer disease requiring prolonged (\u2265 6 months) medical treatment\n  * Medical or surgical treatment that permanently altered gastric absorption (eg, gastric or intestinal surgery). A history of cholecystectomy is not exclusionary\n* Have any serious or active medical or psychiatric illness (including depression) that, in the opinion of the investigator, would interfere with individual treatment, assessment, or compliance with the protocol\n* For Cohort 1, individuals with CYP2C19 genotype of CYP2C19\\*2/\\*2, CYP2C19\\*2/\\*3, or CYP2C19\\*3/\\*3\n\nNote: Other protocol defined Inclusion/Exclusion criteria may apply.",
