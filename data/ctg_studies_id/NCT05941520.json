    "eligibilityCriteria": "Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Age \\>= 35 years\n* Considered clinically premenopausal\n* Having regular menstrual cycles (between 21 and 35 days) unless a contraceptive device such as progestin containing intrauterine device (IUD) (e.g., Mirena IUD) is being used which suppresses menstrual periods, or premenopausal women who have undergone a hysterectomy, but ovaries are intact\n* Not considering pregnancy for at least 12 months\n* Women of child-bearing potential must be willing to use effective birth control methods (precautions) during study and for 8 weeks prior to fine needle aspiration and for 8 weeks after study completion as tamoxifen may have teratogenic effects on the developing fetus.

Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while participating in this study, she should inform her study physician immediately. Two of the following are recommended but woman must agree to at least one of the following methods:\n\n  * Hormonal-impregnated intrauterine device (IUD) or rings\n  * Non-hormonal IUD\n  * Barrier method (such as condoms and diaphragms or cervical caps with or without a spermicide)\n  * Partner has had a vasectomy\n* Must have increased breast cancer risk as predicted by any one or more of the conditions listed below or increased model calculated risk as below:\n\n  * Any one or more of the following conditions associated with increased risk (condition must be documented in electronic medical record or copy of relevant pathology or genetic testing reports submitted with the eligibility checklist)\n\n    * A prior biopsy at any time in the past showing ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), lobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS), atypical hyperplasia.

First degree relative is defined as parent, sibling, or child. Second degree relative is defined as grandparent, uncle, aunt, nephew, niece, half-sibling, grandchild or first cousin\n    * Two or more affected first or second-degree relatives from either the maternal or paternal lineage without regard to age\n    * Bilateral breast cancer or breast and ovarian cancer in the same first or second degree relative without regard to age.\n    * High mammographic density defined as either visual estimate of area of density (VAS) \\> 50%, or Volpara (Trademark) \\>= 15% dense volume (Volpara d) or Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BIRADS) assessment of extremely dense (BIRADs D)\n  * Alternatively, instead of Conditions listed above, , increased risk of breast cancer as calculated by standard models (Breast Cancer Risk Assessment Tool \\[BCRAT\\] Version 2, IBIS Version 8, Breast Cancer Surveillance Consortium)\n\n    * 5-year BCRAT Version 2.0 \\>= 1.66%\n    * 10-year IBIS Version 8 of \\>= 3% or Breast Cancer Surveillance Consortium Version 2 of \\>= 3%\n    * 10 -year IBIS Version 8 age specific relative risk of\n\n      * Age 35-39 10-year relative risk of \\>= 5X that for age group\n      * Age 40-44 10-year risk of \\>= 4X that for age group\n      * Age 45 and up 10-year risk of \\>= 2X\n    * IBIS Version 8 Remaining lifetime risk of \\>= 25% or \\>= 2X that of population\n  * A copy of the output of model calculations from IBIS Version 8 (http://www.emstrials.org/riskevaluator/), BCRAT Version 2.0 (https://dceg.cancer.gov/tools/riskassessment/bcra) or BCSC version 2.0 (https://tools.bcsc-scc.org/BC5yearRisk/calculator.htm) online tools, if used for qualifying risk assessment, or polygenetic risk score should be submitted with the eligibility checklist. Otherwise, these risk qualifying factors need to be documented in the medical record if that is considered the source document\n* Women must have at least 1 unaffected untreated breast for fine needle aspiration.
