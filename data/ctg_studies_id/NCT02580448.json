Can provide written informed consent or have their legal representatives provide written informed consent\n3. Have documented histological or cytological evidence of invasive cancer of the breast, defined by one of the following:\n\n   * ER+ breast cancer, defined as positive if \u2265 1% by IHC and HER2 normal, defined as IHC 0-1+ or IHC 2+(and FISH\\<2), or FISH \\< 2.0\n   * TNBC, defined as ER-/PgR- if 0 % by IHC and HER2 normal, defined as IHC 0-1+ or IHC 2+(and FISH\\<2), or FISH \\< 2.0\n4.

Subjects must have adequate hematopoietic function as evidenced by:\n\n   * WBC \u2265 3,000/\u03bcl\n   * ANC \u2265 1,500/\u03bcl\n   * Platelet count \u2265 100,000/\u03bcl\n   * HGB \u2265 9 g/dl and not transfusion dependent\n7. Adequate liver function, including all the following:\n\n   * Total serum bilirubin \u22642.0 x ULN unless the subject has documented Gilbert syndrome;\n   * Aspartate and alanine aminotransferase (AST \\& ALT) \u22643.0 x ULN or \u22645.0 x ULN if subject has liver metastasis;\n   * Alkaline phosphatase \u22643.0 x ULN or \u22645 x ULN in case of bone metastasis and/or hepatic metastasis\n8. Subjects must have adequate renal function as evidenced by a serum creatinine of \u2264 2.0 mg/dl.\n9. Potassium (K+) \u22653.5 mEq/L\n10. Women of child-bearing potential must have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test within 72 hours of C1D1.\n11. Women of child-bearing potential and male subjects with a female partner of childbearing potential must use 2 acceptable methods of birth control (one of which must include a condom as a barrier method of contraception) starting at Screening and continuing throughout the study period and for 3 months after final study drug administration i. Two acceptable forms of birth control include:\n\n1. Condom (barrier method of contraception), and 2. One of the following:\n\n1. Oral, injected or implanted hormonal contraception\n2. Placement of an intrauterine device (IUD) or intrauterine system (ISU)\n3.

History of another invasive malignancy \u2264 3 years of C1D1.\n6. A QTcF interval \\>470 msec on the Screening ECG. If the ECG QTcF interval is \\>470 msec, then the mean QTcF of a triplicate ECGs can be used and if the mean is \\<470 msec, the subject may be enrolled.\n7. Clinically significant cardiac arrhythmias (e.g., ventricular tachycardia, ventricular fibrillation, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, torsades de pointes, second degree or third degree atrioventricular heart block without a permanent pacemaker in place).\n8.

Initiated a bone modifying agent (e.g. denosumab) \u2264 28 days of C1D1.\n10. Any medical condition that could preclude their participation in the study, pose an undue medical hazard, or which could interfere with the interpretation of the study results.\n11. A history of seizure \u2264 2 years of C1D1 or those who require prophylactic anti-seizure medications.\n12.
