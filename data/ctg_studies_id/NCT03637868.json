Patient with progressive disease harboring brain metastases after previous WBRT (cohort C)\n\n   * At least 1 measurable CNS lesion \u2265 10 mm on T1-weighted gadolinium-enhanced MRI, OR\n   * At least one CNS tumor measuring 5-9 mm in longest diameter, plus one or two additional CNS tumors measuring \u2265 3 mm in longest diameter, for which the sum of the longest diameters is \u2265 10 mm.\n9. Adequate organ function as evidenced by:\n\n   * Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) \u2265 1.5 x 10e9/L without granulocyte-colony-stimulating factor G-CSF (filgrastim, pegfilgrastim, or equivalent) support within 7 days\n   * Hemoglobin (Hgb) \u2265 9.0 g/dL (90 g/L) without blood transfusion within 7 days\n   * Platelet count \u2265 100 x 10e9/L without platelet transfusion within 7 days\n   * Bilirubin \u2264 1.5 X upper limit of normal (ULN), except for patients with documented history of Gilbert's disease who may have DIRECT bilirubin \u2264 1.5 X ULN\n   * Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) \u2264 2.5 X ULN, except \u2264 5 X ULN for patients with liver metastases\n   * Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) \u2264 2.5 X ULN, except \u2264 5 X ULN for patients with liver metastases\n   * Serum creatinine \u2264 1.5 X ULN; or calculated creatinine clearance \u2265 50 mL/min (using MDRD formula), or measured creatinine clearance \u2265 50 mL/min\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n1. Prior therapy with eribulin.\n2. Patients should not have had major surgery or radiotherapy (therapeutic and/or palliative) within 14 days prior to initiation of study treatment, including CNS-directed radiation therapy. (Minor procedures, such as tumor biopsy, thoracentesis, or intravenous catheter placement are allowed with no waiting period)\n3. Patients may not have the following co morbid disease or concurrent illness:\n\n   * Known cirrhosis, defined as Child Pugh class A or higher liver disease\n   * Other active malignancy, except for non-melanoma skin cancer and carcinoma in situ (of the cervix or bladder)\n   * Any other severe/uncontrolled inter current illness or significant co morbid conditions that in the opinion of the investigator would impair study participation or cooperation\n   * Patients with the presence of an active infection, abscess or fistula\n   * Known leptomeningeal disease or CNS midline shifts.\n   * Any evidence of severe or uncontrolled systemic disease such as clinically significant cardiovascular, pulmonary, hepatic, renal or metabolic disease.\n   * Severe conduction abnormality including significant corrected QT interval QTc prolongation \\>450ms.\n   * Patients with grade 3/4 peripheral neuropathy.\n4. Patient candidate to SRS and or surgical resection\n5. Major clinical symptoms requiring immediate WBRT as defined by \"local tumor board\"\n6. Increase in corticosteroid dose in the week prior to baseline brain MRI\n7. Patients with pacemaker or implantable cardioverter-defibrillator devices incompatible with MRI assessment.\n8. Contraindication to Gadolinium infusion.\n9. Treatment ongoing with other chemotherapy, hormonal therapy, immunotherapy, other investigational agents, or biologic agents for the treatment of cancer except bisphosphonates or denosumab.\n10.
