There should be at least one month between end of chemotherapy treatment and trial entry.\n* ER+ve patients should have received adjuvant hormonal treatment\n* Detection of CK-19 mRNA positive cells in the blood by real time PCR despite the previous administration of chemotherapy and if appropriate hormonal therapy\n* Aged 18 years and over\n* Paraffin-embedded tissue available for tumour histology (EGFR testing, ER, PgR, Her-2-neu testing)\n* Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status (PS) of 0 to 2\n* Patients willing to undergo regular detection of circulating occult tumour cells in the blood by immunocytochemistry and/or RT-PCR\n* Life expectancy of at least 12 weeks\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Any concurrent systemic treatment for breast cancer (including chemotherapy, radiotherapy, hormonotherapy, monoclonal antibodies)\n* Known severe hypersensitivity to ZD1839 or any of the excipients of this product\n* Any evidence of clinically active interstitial lung disease (patients with chronic, stable, radiographic changes who are asymptomatic need not be excluded)\n* Other co-existing malignancies or malignancies diagnosed within the last 5 years with the exception of basal cell carcinoma or cervical cancer in situ\n* Any unresolved chronic toxicity greater than common toxicity criteria (CTC) grade 2 from previous anticancer therapy (except alopecia)\n* Serum bilirubin greater than 1.5 times the upper limit of reference range (ULRR)\n* As judged by the investigator, any evidence of severe or uncontrolled systemic disease (e.g., unstable or uncompensated respiratory, cardiac, hepatic, or renal disease)\n* Alanine amino transferase (ALT) or aspartate amino transferase (AST) greater than 3 times the ULRR.\n* Evidence of any other significant clinical disorder or laboratory finding that makes it undesirable for the subject to participate in the study\n* Pregnancy or breast feeding (women of child-bearing potential). Women of childbearing potential must practice acceptable methods of birth control to prevent pregnancy\n* Concomitant use of phenytoin, carbamazepine, rifampicin, barbiturates, or St John's Wort\n* Treatment with a non-approved or investigational drug within 30 days before Day 1 of study treatment",
