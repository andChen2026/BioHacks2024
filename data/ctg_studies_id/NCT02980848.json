First breast cancer diagnosis (DCIS or stage I-III invasive cancer) within 1-3 years prior to March, 2020.\n  2. Completed active cancer treatment (ongoing endocrine and Herceptin therapy acceptable)\n  3. No evidence of a second breast cancer event in cancer registry or pathology data before recruitment.",
