Patient must be off systemic steroid or any other form of immunosuppressive therapy within 7 days prior to first dose of trial treatment.\n22. Patient is diagnosed with active autoimmune disease that has required systemic treatment in past 2 years (i.e., with use of disease modifying agents, corticosteroids or immunosuppressive drugs). Note: replacement therapy (e.g., thyroxine, insulin, or physiologic corticosteroid replacement therapy for adrenal or pituitary insufficiency) is not considered a form of systemic treatment.\n23. Patient has history of interstitial lung disease or known history of, or any evidence of active, noninfectious pneumonitis.\n24. Patient has history of severe allergic, anaphylactic, or other hypersensitivity reactions to chimeric or humanized antibodies or prior allogeneic bone marrow transplantation or prior solid organ transplantation.\n25.
