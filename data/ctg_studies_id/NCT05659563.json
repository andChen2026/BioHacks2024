Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0-1.\n4. Women in a well-determined premenopausal status as indicated in the protocol Section 4.1.\n5. Histologically confirmed invasive breast carcinoma, with all the following characteristics:\n\n   1. Documented ER-positive tumor in accordance with American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO)/College of American Pathologists (CAP) guidelines (Allison et al., 2020), assessed locally and defined as \u2265 1% of tumor cells stained positive.\n   2. Documented HER2-negative tumor in accordance with 2018 ASCO/CAP guidelines (Wolff et al., 2018), assessed locally at baseline.\n\n      Note: Diagnostic biopsy taken no more than 8 weeks prior to initiation of study treatment can be used as baseline.\n   3. Ki67 score \u226510% analyzed locally and centrally confirmed (Nielsen et al., 2021).\n\n      Note: Ki67 will be analyzed locally at the time of inclusion. Patients with basal Ki67 \u226520% will be assessed locally and centrally confirmed retrospectively and patients with 10-19% will be assessed centrally before inclusion.\n   4. Tumor size must be \u22651.0 cm in longest diameter by ultrasound as per Response Evaluation Criteria in solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria.\n\n   Note: Patients with multifocal or multicentric breast cancer with a at least one tumor lesion \u22651.0 cm in the longest diameter by ultrasound (reference lesion) are also eligible if the two largest lesions have been histologically confirmed in the clinical evaluation and meet pathologic criteria for ER positivity and HER2 negativity.\n6. Willingness to provide a primary tumor tissue and blood sample obtained at baseline as well as a post-treatment tumor tissue and blood samples (breast biopsy or from breast surgery).\n7. Patient has adequate bone marrow, liver, and renal function:\n\nHematological: absolute neutrophil count (ANC) \u2265 1.5 x 109/L (1500/mL), platelet count \u2265 100.0 x109/L, and hemoglobin \u2265 9 g/dL (\u2265 90g/L).\n\nNote: The blood counts are to meet the specified criteria without transfusion or growth factor support, unless it is clear that the bone marrow function is adequate and that any aberration has a clear and correctable cause, and the correction undertaken.\n\nHepatic: total serum bilirubin \u2264 1.5' institutional upper limit of normal (ULN) (patients with known Gilbert's syndrome: \u2264 3' ULN); alkaline phosphatase (ALP) \u2264 2.5 times ULN; aspartate transaminase (AST) and serum alanine transaminase (ALT) \u2264 3' times ULN.\n\nCoagulation: The international normalized ratio (INR) \\< 1.5' ULN and partial thromboplastin time (PTT or aPTT) \\< 1.5' ULN (except for patients receiving anticoagulation therapy). For patients receiving warfarin, a stable INR between 2 and 3 is required. For patients receiving heparin, PTT (or aPTT) between 1.5 and 2.5' ULN (or patient value before starting heparin treatment) is required. If anticoagulation therapy is required for a prosthetic heart valve, stable INR between 2.5 and 3.5 is permitted.\n\nRenal: creatinine clearance \u2265 60 mL/min for patients with creatinine levels above institutional normal.\n\nNegative serum pregnancy test result within 14 days prior to initiation of study treatment and a negative urine pregnancy test within 24 hours prior to study treatment initiation.\n\nNote: Premenopausal women age \u226518 years with premenopausal status defined as: estradiol (E2) in the premenopausal range (according to institution parameters) or patient has been menstruating regularly during the 6 months prior to randomization and has not used any form of hormonal contraception or any other hormonal treatments during this time.\n\nWomen must remain abstinent and truly abstains from sexual activity (refrains from heterosexual intercourse) or use of locally recognized adequate methods of contraception (described as that with a failure rate \\<1%) during the length of the study, and to continue its use for 10 days after the last dose of study treatment (for patients taking giredestrant) or 9 months following cessation of therapy (for patients in the tamoxifen arm). They must, as well, agree to refrain from donating eggs during the same period of time.\n\nExamples of non-hormonal contraceptive method with a failure rate of \\<1% per year (e.g. bilateral tubal ligation, male sterilization and copper intrauterine devices). The reliability of sexual abstinence should be evaluated in relation to the duration of the clinical trial and the preferred and usual lifestyle of the individual. Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, or postovulation methods) and withdrawal are not adequate methods of contraception.\n\n9. Patients must be accessible for treatment and follow-up.\n\n10. Participants who are able and willing to swallow, retain, and absorb oral medication.\n\nExclusion criteria\n\n1. Patients will be excluded from the study if they meet ANY of the following criteria:\n2. Progesterone receptor (PgR)\\[+\\] and ER\\[-\\] patients.\n\n   cT4 and/or cN2/3 and/or bilateral BC.\n3. Patients who have history of any prior (ipsilateral and/or contralateral) invasive BC or Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS).
