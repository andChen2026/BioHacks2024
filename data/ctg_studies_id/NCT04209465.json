Myocardial infarction, severe or unstable angina within 6 months prior to baseline\n  3. Significant thrombotic or embolic events within 3 months prior to baseline\n  4. History or presence of any uncontrolled cardiovascular disease\n  5. Personal or family history of long QT syndrome\n* ECG findings meeting any of the following criteria:\n\n  1. Evidence of second- or third-degree atrioventricular block\n  2. Clinically significant arrhythmia (as determined by the Investigator)\n  3. QTcF interval of \\>470 msec\n* Leptomeningeal or untreated and/or symptomatic CNS malignancies (primary or metastatic)\n* Women who are pregnant or breast-feeding\n* Taking or unable to discontinue proton pump inhibitors within 1 week prior to baseline\n* Known concurrent KRAS mutation\n* Known tumor-harboring resistance mutations including EGFR T790M or C797S mutations or HER2 C805S mutation\n\nPhase 2 Only:\n\n- Prior documented treatment response to approved or investigational HER2 or EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapies",
