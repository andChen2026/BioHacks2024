Unambiguous development of a new lesion from the time of scan taken prior to starting ST\n     3. Progressive enlargement of a known metastasis on 2 consecutive imaging (CT or MRI) 2-3 months apart, while on ST, with a minimum 5 mm increase in size from baseline.\n  2. Remainder of metastatic disease stable or regressing, as per RECIST v1.1, evidenced by \\>2 consecutive images within the past 4-6 months.\n* Able to provide written consent\n* ECOG performance status 0-3\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* \u22656 progressive metastases\n* Evidence of spinal cord compression or acute event requiring urgent/emergency radiotherapy\n* Prior radiotherapy, with fields overlapping, resulting in excessive doses to organs at risk\n* Previous radical RT in the area of OP\n* Inability to safely treat all sites of progressing metastases\n* Patient cannot tolerate physical set-up required for SBRT\n* Treatment plan respecting normal tissue tolerances using dose fractionation specified within the protocol cannot be achieved\n* Active bowel obstruction, if treating abdominal/pelvic site\n* Neuroendocrine, lymphoma, myeloma or germ cell malignancies\n* Familial syndromes: Von Hippel-Lindau disease, Polycystic Kidney Disease, Hereditary Papillary RCC or Tuberous Sclerosis",
