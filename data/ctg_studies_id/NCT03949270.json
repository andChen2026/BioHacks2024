    "eligibilityCriteria": "Inclusion Criteria:\n\n1. Patients with histologically confirmed stage I-III, estrogen and/or progesterone receptor positive, as defined by ASCO-CAP guidelines, invasive breast cancer for whom adjuvant hormonal therapy is indicated following standard NCCN practice guidelines.42\n2. Patients must initiate an aromatase inhibitor (AI), with the choice of AI (letrozole, anastrozole, or exemestane) left to the discretion of the treating provider (have just started or plan to start within 4 weeks)\n3. Patients with synchronous bilateral breast cancers are eligible if both tumors are hormone receptor positive.\n4. Patient must be able to provide informed consent and agree to:\n\n   1. Complete questionnaires according to the pre-specified study design\n   2. Own or have access to a personal cell phone, agree to send and receive text messages (including any costs), and share their personal cell phone number to receive text messages.\n   3. Be able to read/speak English\n   4. To allow research staff to contact their pharmacies to determine prescription refill dates.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n1. Patients with history of prior stage I-III breast cancer in the same or contralateral breast are not eligible (because exposure to prior endocrine therapy may confound results)\n2. Patients with metastatic breast cancer.\n3. Patients with ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) or other pre-malignant lesions of the breast receiving endocrine therapy as chemoprevention.\n4. Prior treatment with an aromatase inhibitor, regardless of indication.\n5. Prior tamoxifen for the current cancer (prior tamoxifen for DCIS or a different cancer is permitted).",
