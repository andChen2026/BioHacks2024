Is already participating in another clinical trial.\n8. Has severe systemic disease and/or uncontrolled infection.\n9. Has insufficient cardiac function: echocardiography showed LVEF\\< 50%.\n10. Has suffered from severe cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases disease within the 6 months previous of randomization (such as unstable angina, chronic heart failure, uncontrolled hypertension with blood pressure\\>150/90 mmHg, myocardial infarction, or cerebrovascular accident.\n11.
