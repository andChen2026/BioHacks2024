If the primary lesion is the only measurable lesion according to RECIST criteria, every locoregional treatment must be mentioned to the investigators.\n* Histologically confirmed triple negative breast cancer (ER: \\< 10% nuclear staining of tumor cells on IHC; HER2: either score 0 or 1 at immunohistochemistry or negative at in situ hybridization \\[CISH or FISH\\] in case of score 2 or 3 on IHC)\n* Histological confirmation of triple negative breast cancer of a metastatic lesion is recommended\n* Histological or cytological confirmation of metastatic breast cancer is required in case of normal CA 15.3 levels\n* Primary tumor or metastasis tissue (10 x10 \u03bcm blank slides FFPE tumor material) sent to NKI-AVL for BRCA-like testing\n* Pretreatment histological biopsy of a metastatic lesion for the translational research questions (tumor tissue from bone metastases cannot be used).\n* No previous cytotoxic therapy for metastatic disease\n* Disease-free interval of at least 12 months after completion of adjuvant paclitaxel or platinum compound therapy\n* Disease-free interval of at least 6 months after completion of adjuvant docetaxel\n* Measurable disease according to RECIST v1.1\n* WHO performance status of 0 or 1\n* Adequate bone marrow function: neutrophils \u2265 1.5 x 10E9 cells/l, platelets \u2265100 x 10E9 cells/l, Hb \u2265 6.2 mmol/l.\n* Normal liver function: bilirubin \\< 1.5 x upper limit of the normal range (ULN); alkaline phosphatase \\< 2.5 x ULN (\\< 5 x ULN in case of liver metastases, and \\< 7 x ULN in case of bone metastases); transaminases (ASAT/ALAT) \\< 2.5 x ULN (and \\< 5 x ULN in case of liver metastases).\n* Normal renal function:\n\n  \\> calculated (Cockcroft-Gault) or measured creatinine clearance \\> 50 mL/min\n* INR \\< 1.5 and APTT normal, unless patient is on stable anti-coagulant treatment for at least two weeks with a low molecular weight heparin or coumarin, then an INR within the target range (usually between 2 and 3) is allowed.\n* Written informed consent\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Receptor conversion to hormone receptor positive (defined as \\>= 10% positive ER or PgR tumor cells) or HER2 positive\n* Another cancer except basal-cell carcinoma of the skin or in situ cervical cancer within the previous 5 years\n* Other antitumor therapy within the previous 21 days with the exception of endocrine therapy. The patient should have stopped any endocrine therapy before start study treatment.\n* Radiotherapy with palliative intent within the previous 7 days before randomization.\n* Known CNS disease except for treated brain metastases.\n* Uncontrolled serious medical or psychiatric illness\n* Pre-existing peripheral neuropathy \\> grade 1 (NCI-CTC AE (version 4.03)) at inclusion\n* Severe infection within 4 weeks prior to randomization\n* received antibiotocs within 2 weeks prior to cycle 1, day 1\n* Major surgical procedure, open biopsy, or significant traumatic injury within 28 days prior to randomization or anticipation of need for major surgical procedure during the course of the study\n* New York Heart Association Class II or greater congestive heart failure. LVEF by MUGA, ultrasound or MRI must be \u2265 50% and should be performed within 4 weeks prior to randomization if cardiac failure is suspected.\n* History of myocardial infarction or unstable angina within 6 months prior to randomization\n* History of myocardial infarction or unstable angina or unstable arrhytmias within 3 months prior to randomization\n\nfuther criteria, see protocol",
