    "primaryOutcomeMeasure": "To evaluate the objective response rate when ZARNESTRA is added to administration of tamoxifen in patients suffering from metastatic or advanced inoperable breast cancer, who are progressing on tamoxifen treatment",
    "eligibilityCriteria": "Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Histologically proven, metastatic or locally advanced inoperable breast cancer\n* Tumor considered potentially hormone-sensitive, i.e. presence by IHC of hormone receptors for estrogens (ER+ for more than 10% of cells) and/or progesterone (Pg+ for more than 10% of cells) or both. This expression may have been detected on the primary tumor or at a metastatic site. The method used will be reassessed by IHC if it involves a radioligand technique whenever it is possible to obtain histological material.\n* Progressing on treatment with tamoxifen, given either as adjuvant treatment or for advanced/metastatic breast cancer. Any previous treatment with a steroidal or nonsteroidal antiaromatase in a neo-adjuvant, adjuvant or metastatic situation is permitted. Likewise, any previous treatment with chemotherapy and/or herceptin in a nonmetastatic situation is permitted.\n* Post-menopausal patients\n* Age \\> 18 years\n* At least one measurable lesion according to the Response Evaluation Criteria for Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria; for patients who only have bone metastases, an evaluable non-irradiated lytic lesion is required\n* Performance Status (WHO): PS \u2264 2 (Appendix 1).\n* Laboratory tests in accordance with the following criteria:\n\nNeutrophils \u2265 2x109/l,Platelets \u2265 100x109/l,Hemoglobin \u2265 10 g/dl, ASAT, ALAT \u2264 2.5 N , or \\< 5 N when liver metastasis,bilirubin \u2264 1.5 N creatinin \u2264 1.5 N\n\n* Signed, written consent before any study-related procedure\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Men\n* Pre-menopausal patients who are not receiving concurrent LHRH agonist therapy\n* ER- and PR-negative patients\n* Contraindication to antiestrogens (thromboembolic risk) or ZARNESTRA\n* Non metastatic tumor susceptible to management by radiotherapeutic and/or surgical means\n* T4d inflammatory tumor (PEV 2 or 3).\n* Short-term, life-threatening lesions: hepatic invasion \\> 1/3 of liver volume, pulmonary lymphangitis, uncontrolled cerebral metastases, carcinomatous meningitis\n* Sensory neuropathy \\> or = grade 1 (WHO)\n* Previous history of uncontrolled cancers or controlled for less than 5 years, except basal cell skin cancers and in situ cancers of the cervix.\n* Chronic diseases (somatic or psychiatric) with a poor prognosis\n* subjects with enzyme-inducing anti-convulsants (e.g., phenytoin, phenobarbital, carbamazepine) : this treatment is not permitted while taking ZARNESTRA\n* Patients who, for family, social, geographic or psychological reasons, could not be followed up correctly.",
