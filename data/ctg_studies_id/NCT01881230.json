Female subjects, age \u2265 18 years at the time informed consent is signed\n2. Pathologically confirmed adenocarcinoma of the breast\n3. Pathologically confirmed as triple negative, source documented, defined as both of the following\n\n   1. Estrogen Receptor (ER) and Progesterone Receptor (PgR) negative: \\< 1% of tumor cell nuclei are immunoreactive in the presence of evidence that the sample can express ER or PgR (positive intrinsic controls)\n   2. Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor 2 (HER2) negative as per American Society of Clinical Oncology - College of American Pathologists (ASCO/CAP) guidelines i. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) 0 or 1 Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization (FISH) negative (or equivalent negative test). Subjects with IHC 2 must have a negative by Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization (FISH),, (or equivalent negative test).\n4. Subjects with prior breast cancer history of different phenotypes (ie, ER/PgR/HER2 positive) must have pathologic confirmation of triple negative disease in at least one of the current sites of metastasis\n5. Subjects must have received prior adjuvant or neoadjuvant anthracycline therapy; unless (a) anthracycline treatment was not indicated or was not the best treatment option for the subject in the opinion of the treating physician; and (b) anthracycline treatment remains not indicated or, in the opinion of the treating physician, is not the best treatment option for the subject's metastatic disease.\n\n   a. Newly diagnosed subjects presenting with TNMBC are eligible for the study if anthracycline treatment is not indicated or is not the best treatment option for the subject in the opinion of the treating physician.\n6. Subjects with measurable metastatic disease, defined by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors 1.1 (RECIST 1.1) guidelines\n7. Life expectancy \u2265 16 weeks from randomization\n8. No prior cytotoxic chemotherapy for metastatic breast cancer. Prior immunotherapy and/or monoclonal antibody therapy are acceptable.

Prior neoadjuvant or adjuvant chemotherapy, if given, must have been completed at least 6 months before randomization with all related toxicities resolved, and documented evidence of disease progression per RECIST 1.1 guidelines is required.\n\n   a. If prior neoadjuvant or adjuvant chemotherapy contained taxane, gemcitabine, or platinum agents, the treatment must have completed at least 12 months before randomization\n10. Prior radiotherapy must have completed before randomization, with full recovery from acute radiation side effects. At least one measurable lesion must be completely outside the radiation portal or there must be unequivocal radiologic or clinical exam proof of progressive disease within the radiation portal, in accordance with RECIST 1.1 guidelines\n11. At least 30 days from major surgery before randomization, with full recovery\n12. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 0-1\n13. Subject has the following blood counts at screening:\n\n    * Absolute Neutrophil Count (ANC) \u2265 1500/mm\\^2 ;\n    * Platelets \u2265 100,000/mm\\^2 ;\n    * Hemoglobin (Hgb) \u2265 9 g/dL\n14.

Females must abstain from breastfeeding starting at randomization, during study participation and for 28 days or longer as required by local guidelines, after IP discontinuation\n17. Understand and voluntarily sign an informed consent document prior to any study related assessments/procedures are conducted\n18. Able to adhere to the study visit schedule and other protocol requirements\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\nA subject will not be eligible for inclusion in this study if any of the following criteria apply:\n\n1. Male subjects\n2. Concurrent chemotherapy or any other anti tumor therapy for breast cancer. Prior immunotherapy \\& monoclonal antibody therapy are acceptable.\n3. Subjects who received prior cytotoxic chemotherapy after incomplete resection of locoregional recurrent disease\n4. History of, or known current evidence of brain metastasis, including leptomeningeal involvement.\n5. Subjects with bone as the only site of metastatic disease\n6. Subjects with regional lymph node as the only site of metastatic disease\n7. Serious intercurrent medical or psychiatric illness, including serious active infection\n8. History of class II-IV congestive heart failure or myocardial infarction within 6 months of randomization\n9. History of other primary malignancy in the last 5 years prior to randomization. Subjects with prior breast cancer history are eligible, however, the most recently obtained biopsy must demonstrate triple negative disease (source documented). Subjects with prior history of in situ cancer or basal or localized squamous cell skin cancer are eligible.\n10. Subjects with a history of interstitial lung disease, history of slowly progressive dyspnea and unproductive cough, sarcoidosis, silicosis, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, pulmonary hypersensitivity pneumonitis or multiple uncontrolled or unstable allergies which, in the opinion of the investigator, may lead to serious complications\n11.
