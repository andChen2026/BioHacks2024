    "eligibilityCriteria": "Inclusion Criteria:\n\n1. Age \u226518 years old, male or female;\n2. Patients with advanced malignant solid tumors confirmed by histology or pathology, including colorectal cancer, esophageal cancer, gastric cancer, pancreatic cancer, non-small cell lung cancer, breast cancer, and cholangiocarcinoma;\n3. Progression or intolerance occurs after receiving systematic standard therapy according to guidelines,(systemic therapy including but not limited to systemic chemotherapy, molecular targeting, etc.) and is not suitable for surgery or local therapy (including ablative therapy, interventional therapy, and radiation therapy), among which colorectal cancer needs to receive at least third-line therapy failure or intolerance or inapplicability. Esophageal, gastric, non-small cell lung, breast, and cholangiocarcinoma require at least second-line treatment failure or intolerance or inadequacy, and pancreatic cancer require at least first-line treatment failure or intolerance or inadequacy:\n\n   1. Advanced colorectal cancer: progression or intolerance or inadequacy after third-line standard therapy including cetuximab \u00b1 Irinotecan/regorafenib /fruquintinib/trifluridine\uff1b\n   2. Advanced or metastatic esophageal cancer/esophagogastric junction cancer: patients with esophageal cancer who progress or are intolerant or inapplicable after second-line therapy including PD-1 MAB /PD-L1 mab; Patients with esophagogastric junction cancer progressed or were intolerant or inapplicable after second-line therapy including taxane or irinotecan or PD-1 /PD-L1 monoclonal antibody; For HER-2 positive patients, trastuzumab containing system therapy should fail or be intolerable or not applicable;\n   3. Advanced/metastatic gastric cancer: the combination of PD-1 MAB /PD-L1 MAB and chemotherapy has been developed or is not tolerated or suitable; For HER-2 positive patients, systemic treatment containing trastuzumab should fail or be intolerable or inapplicable.\n   4. Patients with advanced, metastatic, or recurrent non-small cell lung cancer who have received systemic treatment progression or intolerance, including: Patients with positive driver genes (EGFR, ALK, ROS1, BRAF, NTRK, MET, RET) should receive targeted therapy failure or drug resistance (squamous cell carcinoma does not require driver gene testing). In addition, patients with EGFR-positive driver gene who are resistant to first-line EGFR-Tkis and who are positive for EGFR T790M mutations need to be treated with third-generation EGFR-TKI (such as Osimertinib, almonertinib, or furmonertinib) after failure or resistance. For patients with positive ALK fusion and drug resistance after first-line crizotinib treatment, second-line treatment with ceritinib or alectinib should fail or be resistant; Patients with PD-L1 expression (PD-L1 TPS\u22651%) should undergo immune checkpoint inhibitor treatment failure or intolerance; In patients with negative driver genes, the disease progresses or becomes intolerable after chemotherapy with platinum-containing regiments-such as Camrelizumab, Pembrolizumab, Tislelizumab, Sintilimab or Atezolizumab combined with pemetrexed\n   5. Advanced, metastatic breast cancer: HER-2 positive patients need to have received anti-HER-2 therapy, hormone receptor positive patients need to receive endocrine therapy and other standard treatments have failed or are intolerable or not applicable, and rescue chemotherapy for those who have failed/are intolerable or triple-negative breast cancer (including: Gemcitabine + cisplatin/carboplatin, albumin paclitaxel/other taxoid drugs + cisplatin/carboplatin) fail or are not tolerated or suitable;\n   6. Locally advanced or metastatic pancreatic cancer: advanced or intolerant or inappropriate after at least first-line treatment, including: Gemcitabine + albumin-bound paclitaxel/cisplatin/erlotinib/capecitabine/tegafur/Nimotuzumab, or FOLFIRINOX (oxaliplatin + irinotecan +LV+5-FU), or mFOLFIRINOX (oxaliplatin + irinotecan + calcium folinate +5-FU);\n   7. Advanced cholangiocarcinoma: progression or intolerance or inapplicability after at least second-line therapy (mFOLFOX); Remarks: Chemotherapy failure is defined as disease progression or intolerable toxicity during treatment or within 3 months after the last dose; If patients cannot receive the above treatment for economic reasons, those whose benefits outweigh the risks of inclusion in the study can be enrolled.\n4. Subjects with positive CEA (IHC score 3+) in tumor tissue samples (paraffin sections or fresh tissue specimens or puncture biopsy samples) within 3 months before screening; If the immunohistochemical results of the tumor samples are more than 3 months from the time of screening, the patient needs to re-biopsy; If the tumor specimens are not available or the amount is too small for immunohistochemical detection of CEA, the CEA positive can be confirmed by re-staining of previous tissue specimens, and the peripheral blood serum CEA\u22652.0\u00d7ULN can be included in the group.\n5. Have at least one evaluable target lesion according to RECIST 1.1 criteria;\n6.
