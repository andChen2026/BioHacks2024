Patients with the following medication history:\n\n   * anti-ErbB3 targeted therapies\n   * small-molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors within 2 weeks prior to baseline\n   * any anti-cancer therapy, including chemotherapy, radiotherapy, biologic therapy, retinoid therapy, or therapeutic/palliative radiotherapy for the treatment of advanced solid tumors within 4 weeks prior to baseline\n   * Granulocyte-Colony Stimulating Factor (G-CSF), packed red cell or platelet transfusion within 2 weeks prior to the first injection of IP to correct the abnormal values of absolute neutrophil count (ANC) or platelet count\n6. Pregnant woman, breastfeeding woman, or women of childbearing age and men with partners of childbearing age, unless they are willing to follow abstinence or use effective forms of contraception\\* from the study entry until at least 16 weeks after the EOT visit\n7. Subjects receiving any other investigational products or medical devices within 4 weeks prior to screening\n8. Principal investigator's opinion\n\n\\[Part 1 Dose-escalation cohort\\]\n\n1. Patients with severe hypersensitivity or history of hypersensitivity to the similar drug class of the investigational product.\n2. Patients receiving anti-cancer therapy, including chemotherapy, radiotherapy, biologic therapy, retinoid therapy, or therapeutic/palliative radiotherapy for treatment of advanced solid tumors within four weeks prior to baseline.\n\n\\[Part 2 dose-expansion cohort\\]\n\n1. Patients with history of allergy or hypersensitivity to the investigational product (ISU104 or cetuximab) or any excipients of the investigational product or its similar derivatives.\n2. Patients with primary malignant neoplasm, including head and neck cancer as specified in inclusion criteria of Part 2 dose-expansion cohort. However, an exception may be allowed for the following:\n\n   * For respective malignancy, treatment-na\u00efve or disease-free patients for at least three years (however, patients undergoing radical resection on papillary thyroid carcinoma may be eligible for this clinical trial, even though three years have not passed).\n   * Total dissection of skin basal cell carcinoma/squamous cell carcinoma or at least one year had passed since successful treatment of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia.\n3. Patients receiving anti-cancer therapy, including chemotherapy, radiotherapy, biologic therapy, retinoid therapy, therapeutic/palliative radiotherapy, or hormone therapy for treatment of advanced solid tumors within four weeks prior to baseline.",
