    "eligibilityCriteria": "Inclusion Criteria\n\nSubjects who meet all of the following criteria will be included in the study:\n\nDose-escalation cohorts (Phase 1b):\n\n1. Histologically or cytologically confirmed cancer that is advanced and/or metastatic\n2. Resistant/refractory to approved therapies (defined as progressive disease during or within 6 months after the last anti-cancer therapy) or for whom single agent capecitabine at this dose level and schedule would be a reasonable treatment option in the opinion of the investigator\n3. For subjects that previously received capecitabine, all capecitabine related toxicities must have completely resolved\n4. Adequate bone marrow function as evidenced by absolute neutrophil count (ANC) greater than or equal to 1.5 x 10\\^9/L, hemoglobin greater than or equal to 10.0 g/dL (this may have been corrected by growth factor or transfusion), and platelet count greater than or equal to 100 x 10\\^9/L\n5. Adequate liver function as evidenced by bilirubin less than or equal to 1.5 times the upper limit of normal (ULN) and alkaline phosphatase (AP), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) less than or equal to 3 x ULN (in the case of liver metastases less than or equal to 5 x ULN). In case AP is greater than 3 x ULN (in absence of liver metastases) or greater than 5 x ULN (in presence of liver metastases) AND subject also is known to have bone metastases, the liver specific AP must be separated from the total and used to assess the liver function instead of the total AP.\n6. Adequate renal function as evidenced by calculated creatinine clearance greater than or equal to 50 mL/min as per the Cockcroft-Gault formula (Appendix 1) or radioisotope measurement.\n7. Females of childbearing potential must have a negative urine or serum beta human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) at Visit 1 (Screening) and prior to starting study drugs on Day 1. Female subjects of childbearing potential must agree to be abstinent or to use highly effective methods of contraception (e.g., condom + spermicide, condom + diaphragm with spermicide, intrauterine device (IUD), or have a vasectomized partner) having starting for at least one menstrual cycle prior to starting study drug(s) and throughout the entire study period and for 30 days (longer if appropriate) after the last dose of study drug. Those women using hormonal contraceptives must also be using an additional approved method of contraception (as described previously). Perimenopausal women must be amenorrheic for at least 12 months to be considered of nonchildbearing potential.\n8. Male subjects who are not abstinent or have not undergone a successful vasectomy, who are partners of women of childbearing potential must use, or their partners must use, a highly affective method of contraception (e.g. condom + spermicide, condom + diaphragm with spermicide, IUD) starting for at least one menstrual cycle prior to starting study drug(s) and throughout the entire study period and for 30 days (longer if appropriate) after the last dose of study drug. Those with partners using hormonal contraceptives must also be using an additional approved method of contraception (as described previously)\n9. Life expectancy of greater than 3 months\n10. Willing and able to comply with all aspects of the protocol\n11. Provide written informed consent\n12. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status (PS) less than or equal to 2\n13. Males and females, age greater than or equal to18 years\n\nDose-confirmation cohorts (Phase 2):\n\n1. Histologically or cytologically confirmed carcinoma of the breast that is advanced and/or metastatic\n2. Received up to three prior chemotherapy regimens in any setting (sequential neoadjuvant/ adjuvant treatment counting as one regimen)\n3. Chemotherapy regimens must have included an anthracycline (unless anthracycline containing chemotherapy is inappropriate) and a taxane, either in combination or in separate regimens\n4. No prior treatment with capecitabine in any setting\n5. At least one lesion of greater than or equal to 1.5cm in longest diameter for non-lymph nodes and greater than or equal to 1.5cm in shortest diameter for lymph nodes which is serially measurable according to the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1 7\n6. Adequate bone marrow function as evidenced by ANC greater than or equal to 1.5 x 10\\^9/L, hemoglobin greater than or equal to 10.0 g/dL (this may have been corrected by growth factor or transfusion), and platelet count greater than or equal to 100 x 10\\^9/L\n7. Adequate liver function as evidenced by bilirubin less than or equal to 1.5 times the upper limits of normal (ULN) and alkaline phosphatase (AP), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) less than or equal 3 x ULN (in the case of liver metastases less than or equal to 5 x ULN). In case AP is greater than 3 x ULN (in absence of liver metastases) or greater than 5 x ULN (in presence of liver metastases) AND subject also is known to have bone metastases, the liver specific AP must be separated from the total and used to assess the liver function instead of the total AP.\n8. Adequate renal function as evidenced by calculated creatinine clearance greater than or equal to 50 mL/min as per the Cockcroft-Gault formula (Appendix 1) or radioisotope measurement.\n9. Females of childbearing potential must have a negative urine or serum beta hCG at Visit 1 (Screening) and prior to starting study drugs on Day 1. Female subjects of childbearing potential must agree to be abstinent or to use highly effective methods of contraception (e.g., condom + spermicide, condom + diaphragm with spermicide, IUD, or have a vasectomized partner) having starting for at least one menstrual cycle prior to starting study drug(s) and throughout the entire study period and for 30 days (longer if appropriate) after the last dose of study drug. Those women using hormonal contraceptives must also be using an additional approved method of contraception (as described previously). Perimenopausal women must be amenorrheic for at least 12 months to be considered of non-childbearing potential\n10. Life expectancy of greater than 3 months\n11. Willing and able to comply with all aspects of the protocol\n12. ECOG-PS 0 or 1\n13. Females, age greater than or equal to 18 years\n\nExclusion Criteria\n\nSubjects who meet any of the following criteria will be excluded from participation in the study:\n\n1. Radiotherapy, chemotherapy, biological therapy or investigational agents within 4 weeks prior to the start of study treatment; subjects must have recovered from any previous therapy related toxicity to less than Grade 1 at study entry (except for stable sensory neuropathy less than or equal to Grade 2 and alopecia)\n2. Treatment with mitomycin C or nitrosourea within 6 weeks prior to commencing on study treatment\n3. Hormonal treatment within 2 weeks prior to start of study treatment (continued use of antiandrogens and/or gonadorelin analogues for treatment of prostate cancer permitted)\n4. Prior participation in an eribulin clinical study, even if not assigned to eribulin treatment\n5. Subject with hypersensitivity to halochondrin B and /or halochondrin B chemical derivates or capecitabine or any of the excipients\n6. Suspected dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD) deficiency\n7. Previous radiotherapy encompassing greater than 30% of marrow\n8. Previous organ allograft requiring immunosuppression\n9. Subjects with brain or subdural metastases are not eligible, unless they have completed local therapy and have discontinued the use of corticosteroids for this indication at least 4 weeks before starting study treatment. Any symptoms attributed to brain metastases must be stable for at least 4 weeks before starting study treatment; radiographic stability should be determined by comparing contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) brain scan performed during screening to a prior scan performed at least 4 weeks earlier\n10. Meningeal carcinomatosis\n11. Significant cardiovascular impairment (history of congestive heart failure greater than New York Heart Association \\[NYHA\\] grade II, unstable angina or myocardial infarction within the past 6 months, or serious cardiac arrhythmia)\n12. Electrocardiogram (ECG) with QT interval corrected for heart rate (QTc) interval greater than 470 msec (as measured either by Bazett's or Fredericia's formula)\n13. Pre-existing neuropathy greater than Grade 2\n14. Anti-coagulant therapy with warfarin or related compounds, other than for line patency, that cannot be changed to heparin-based therapy for the duration of the study\n15. Subjects with known positive serology for Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV), or Hepatitis B or C\n16.
