    "eligibilityCriteria": "Key Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Participant has histologically confirmed diagnosis of advanced (loco-regionally recurrent and not amenable to curative therapy, or metastatic (stage IV)) TNBC\n* Participant has completed systemic treatment for Stage I-III breast cancer, if indicated, and \u2265 6 months have elapsed between the completion of systemic treatment with curative intent and disease recurrence\n* A recently or newly obtained tumor biopsy from a metastatic site must be provided for determination of PD-L1 expression using the PD-L1 IHC 22C3 assay by a Novartis designated central laboratory, prior to study randomization. If a result of PD-L1 expression assessed by a PD-L1 IHC 22C3 pharmDx test in a local laboratory is available, this can serve as PD-L1 status confirmation. For Arms A, B and C participants must have PD-L1 positive tumors with CPS\u2265 10. For Arm D, participants must have PD-L1 positive tumors with CPS \u2265 1 to \\< 10.\n* Participant has measurable disease, i.e., at least one measurable lesion per RECIST 1.1 criteria (a lesion at a previously irradiated site may only be counted as a target lesion if there is clear sign of progression since the irradiation)\n* Participant has an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1\n* Participant has life expectancy \u2265 12 weeks from the start of study treatment\n\nKey Exclusion Criteria:\n\n* Participant has received prior treatment with immunotherapy in the metastatic setting, or anti-T cell immunoreceptor with Ig and ITIM domains (TIGIT) therapy in any setting\n* History of severe hypersensitivity to any of the study drugs (i.e. monoclonal antibodies, gemcitabine, carboplatin, nab-paclitaxel, paclitaxel) or its excipients or to drugs of similar chemical classes\n* Participant with inflammatory breast cancer at screening\n* Participant has central nervous system (CNS) involvement which was not previously treated and/or was newly detected at screening. Previously treated CNS involvement must fulfill the following criteria to be eligible for the trial:\n\n  1. Completed prior therapy (including radiation and/or surgery) for CNS metastases \u2265 28 days prior to the start of the study and\n  2. CNS tumor is clinically stable at the time of screening, and\n  3. Participant is not receiving steroids and/or enzyme inducing anti-epileptic medications for brain metastases\n* Participant has an active autoimmune diseases or history of autoimmune diseases that may relapse\n* Participant has not recovered from all toxicities related to prior anticancer therapies to National Cancer Institute (NCI) CTCAE version 5.0 Grade \u22641. Exception to this criterion: participants with any grade of alopecia are allowed to enter the study\n\nOther inclusion/exclusion criteria may apply",
