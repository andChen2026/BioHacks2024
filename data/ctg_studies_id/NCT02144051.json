    "eligibilityCriteria": "Inclusion criteria.\n\n* Patient must understand nature of trial and provide a signed and dated, written informed consent form prior to study specific procedures, sampling and analyses. If a patient declines to participate in voluntary exploratory research and/or genetic component of study, there will be no penalty or loss of benefit to the patient and he/she will not be excluded from other aspects of the study.\n* Part A Dose Escalation Patients must have histological or cytological confirmation of a solid tumour of either locally advanced or metastatic castrate resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC), breast, bladder, ovarian, gastric or salivary duct carcinoma where an Androgen Receptor pathway may be a potential factor.\n* Part B Dose Expansion.\n\n  * Patient must understand nature of trial and provide a signed and dated, written informed consent form prior to any study specific procedures, sampling and analyses.\n  * Part A Dose Escalation Patients must have histological or cytological confirmation of a solid tumour of either locally advanced or metastatic castrate resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC), breast, bladder, ovarian, gastric or salivary duct carcinoma where an Androgen Receptor pathway may be a potential factor.\n  * Part B Dose Expansion Arm 1 and 2 patients must have histological or cytological confirmation of locally advanced or metastatic castrate resistant prostate cancer who have progressive disease at the time of entry demonstrated either by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) (measurable disease) or by two subsequently increasing Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) values obtained at least one week apart. Arm 3 will include non-mCRPC patients. The patient populations in the dose expansion phase will be as follows:\n* Arm 1 Prostate cancer patients with prior second generation anti-hormonal therapy (examples: abiraterone, enzalutamide, TAK 700) without response (disease progression in \u22644 months or Stable Disease (SD) but Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level did not decline \u226550%).\n* Arm 2 Prostate cancer patients with intial response to second generation anti-hormonal therapy (examples: abiraterone, enzalutamide, TAK 700), but later relapsed. Disease relapse would be defined as progressive disease at the time of entry demonstrated either by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1 (measurable disease) or by two subsequently increasing Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) values obtained at least one week apart. If clinically meaningful benefits have been identified in a non-mCRPC patient population during the escalation phase, a potential third expansion arm may be considered.\n* Arm 3 Patients with a non-mCRPC type solid tumour such as locally advanced or metastatic breast, bladder, ovarian, gastric or salivary duct carcinomas.\n* Aged at least 18 years\n* Adequate organ system functions, as outined below - Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) \u22651.5 X109/L - Platelets \u2265100 X109/L - Haemoglobin \u22659g/dL - aPTT \u22641.5 x ULN - Total bilirubin \u22641.5 mg/dL - Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) \u22643.0 times the upper limit of normal (ULN) if no liver involvement or \u22645 times the ULN with liver involvement. - Creatinine \u22641.5 x ULN, OR calculated or measured creatinine clearance \u226550 mL/min as calculated by the Cockcroft-Gault method, OR 24-hour measured urine creatinine clearance \u226550 mL/min.\n* Patients must exhibit Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 0-1.\n* Predicted life expectancy \u226512 weeks\n* Patients should have willingness to comply with the study and follow up.\n* Male patients with female partners of childbearing potential should be willing to use two forms of acceptable contraception, including one barrier method, during their participation in this study and for 3 months following the last dose of the study drug. Male patients must refrain from donating sperm during their participation in the study and at least for 3 months after the last treatment.\n* Female patients should be using adequate contraceptive measures (see Section 3.3). All methods of contraception (with the exception of total abstinence) should be used in combination with the use of a condom by their male sexual partner for intercourse. Female patients should not be breast-feeding and must have a negative pregnancy test prior to start of dosing if of child-bearing potential or must have evidence of non-child-bearing potential by fulfilling one of the following criteria at screening: - Post-menopausal women defined as aged more than 50 years and amenorrhoeic for at least 12 months following cessation of all exogenous hormonal treatment. - Documentation of irreversible surgical sterilisation by hysterectomy, bilateral oophorectomy or bilateral salpingectomy but not tubal ligation.\n\nExclusion criteria\n\n* Patients who have been treated with most recent chemotherapy or investigational drugs \u226421 days or 5 half-lives (whichever is longer) for enrolment, and/or who have National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria of Adverse Events (CTCAE) v4.03 Grade 1 treatment-related side effect, with the exceptions of alopecia, should not be enrolled. For further details, please refer to the following link: http://evs.nci.nih.gov/ftp1/CTCAE/About.html.\n* Patients who received chemotherapy regimens given either continuously or weekly with limited potential for delayed toxicity or palliative/focal radiotherapy within the last 2 weeks or any other radiotherapy or immunotherapy within 3 weeks of the first dose of study treatment.\n* Major surgery (excluding placement of vascular access) \u226421 days of beginning of the study drug or minor surgical procedures \u22647 days. No waiting required following port-a-cath placement.\n* Any of the following cardiac criteria: - Congestive heart failure (CHF) per New York Heart Association (NYHA) classification \\> Class II (see Appendix C) - Cardiac ventricular arrhythmias requiring anti-arrhythmic therapy - Unstable angina or new-onset angina - QTcF \\>470 ms on screening electrocardiogram (ECG) by Fredericia's formula.\n* Patients with leptomeningeal metastases\n* Previously untreated brain metastases. Patients who have received radiation or surgery for brain metastases are eligible if therapy was completed at least 3 weeks previously and there is no evidence of central nervous system disease progression, mild neurologic symptoms, and no requirement for chronic corticosteroid therapy.\n* As judged by the investigator, any evidence of severe or uncontrolled systemic diseases, including uncontrolled hypertension, active bleeding diatheses, or active infection including hepatitis B, hepatitis C and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Screening for chronic conditions is not required.\n* Concurrent conditions that in investigator's opinion would jeopardize compliance with protocol.\n* Psychological, familial, sociological, or geographical conditions that do not permit compliance with protocol.",
