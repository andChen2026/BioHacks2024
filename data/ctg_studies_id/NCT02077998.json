    "eligibilityCriteria": "Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Participants must have metastatic breast cancer that can be biopsied or resected around 48 hours after dosing with one microdose of \\[14C\\]oxaliplatin (carbon C 14 oxaliplatin)\n* Prior radiation or surgery is allowed, but should be finished at least 2 weeks prior to study enrollment; if a participant has prior radiation therapy, at least one measurable lesion outside of the radiation field should be available for the evaluation of response to chemotherapy\n* Patients with metastatic breast cancer for which no standard therapy exists will be recruited for this study; more specifically, for patients with hormone receptor positive/human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (Her2) negative disease, this includes previous therapy with tamoxifen or an aromatase inhibitor and one line of chemotherapy in the metastatic setting; for patients with Her2 positive disease, this includes 2 lines of Her2 directed therapy in the metastatic setting; and for patients with triple negative disease, this includes one line of chemotherapy in the metastatic setting; once we have identified the dose of \\[14C\\]oxaliplatin, we will only recruit triple negative breast cancer patients that progressed after one line of chemotherapy in the metastatic setting\n* Any number of prior therapies other than oxaliplatin is allowed\n* Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status equal to or less than 2 (Karnofsky equal to or greater than 50%)\n* Life expectancy of at least 3 months\n* Absolute neutrophil count greater than or equal to 1,500/microL\n* Platelets greater than or equal to 100,000/microL\n* Total bilirubin less than 1.5 X institutional upper limit of normal (ULN)\n* Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase \\[SGOT\\]) less than or equal to 2.5 X ULN\n* Creatinine less than 1.5 X ULN\n* No pre-existing sensory neuropathy \\> grade 1\n* Women of child bearing potential must not be pregnant; a pre-study pregnancy test must be negative\n* Women of child-bearing potential must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry and for 30 days after study participation\n* Men must agree to use adequate contraception (barrier method or abstinence) prior to study entry and for 30 days after study participation\n* Ability to understand and willing to sign a written informed consent document\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Patients must not receive concomitant radiation with chemotherapy if they do not have any measurable lesions outside of the radiation field\n* Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements\n* Participants who are pregnant or nursing\n* Participants who are allergic to platinum agent\n* Participants who have more than grade 1 peripheral neuropathy",
