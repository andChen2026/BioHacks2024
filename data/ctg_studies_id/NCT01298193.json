Patient is able to understand study procedures and agrees to participate in the study by giving written informed consent.\n4. Patient is naive to moderate or highly emetogenic chemotherapy per \"Hesketh\" criteria.\n5. Patient is scheduled to receive of chemotherapy with Docetaxel-Cyclophosphamide (Docetaxel 75mg/m2 and Cyclophosphamide 600mg/m2) administered every 21 days.\n6. Patient has a predicted life expectancy \u2265 4 months.\n7. Functional State 0-1 Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Scale (see Appendix 12.2).\n8. Patient has an adequate organ function including the following:\n\n   * Bone marrow reserve: Absolute Neutrophil Count \\>1500/mm3 and white blood cell (WBC) count \\>3000/mm3; Platelet Count \\>100.000/mm3\n   * Hepatic: aspartate aminotransferase (AST) \\<2.5 x upper limit of normal; alanine aminotransferase (ALT) \\<2.5 x upper limit of normal; Bilirubin within the normal limit.\n   * Renal: Creatinine \\<1.5 x upper limit of normal.\n9. Premenopausal female patients must demonstrate a negative serum and/or urine pregnancy test within 3 days of study drug administration, and agree to use a double-barrier form of contraception for at least 14 days prior to, throughout and for at least 14 days following the last dose of study medication. Women taking oral contraceptive agents must agree to add a barrier form of contraception. Abstinence is also considered an acceptable form of contraception. (Note: A female patient who is not of reproductive potential is eligible without requiring the use of contraception. A female patient who is not of reproductive potential is defined as one who has either: 1) reached natural menopause (defined as 6 months of spontaneous amenorrhea with serum follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) levels in the postmenopausal range as determined by the laboratory, or 12 months of spontaneous amenorrhea); 2) 6 weeks post surgical bilateral oophorectomy with or without hysterectomy; or 3) bilateral tubal ligation.)\n10.

Patient has received or will receive radiation therapy to the abdomen, chest or pelvis in the month prior to the study enter.\n3. Patient has vomited in the 24 hours prior to Treatment Day 1.\n4. Patient has a history of treatment with emetogenic chemotherapy of moderate or high level per \"Hesketh\" (classification of emetogenic chemotherapy agents).\n5. Patient has an active infection (e.g., pneumonia) or any uncontrolled disease (e.g., diabetic ketoacidosis, gastrointestinal obstruction) except for malignancy which, in the opinion of the investigator, might confound the results of the study or pose unwarranted risk.\n6.

Patient is mentally incapacitated or has a significant emotional or psychiatric disorder that, in the opinion of the investigator, precludes study entry.\n8.

Patient has a history of hypersensitivity to aprepitant, 5-HT3 antagonists, or dexamethasone.\n10. Patient is pregnant or breast feeding.\n11. Patient has participated in a study with aprepitant or has taken a non approved (investigational) drug within the last 4 weeks.\n12. Patient is taking systemic corticosteroid therapy at any dose; topical and inhaled corticosteroids are permitted.\n13. Patient is taking, or will be taking within 28 days of Day 1 of cycle 2 (cycle in which patients will start taking aprepitant) the following CYP3A4 inducers:\n\n    * phenytoin or carbamazepine\n    * barbiturates\n    * rifampicin or rifabutin\n    * St. John's Wort\n14. Patient is taking, or will be taking within 7 days of Day 1 of cycle 2 the following CYP3A4 substrates:\n\n    * terfenadine\n    * cisapride\n    * astemizole\n    * pimozide\n15.
