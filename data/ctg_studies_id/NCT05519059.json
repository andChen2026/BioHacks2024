Voluntarily participating in this trial and having signed the Informed Consent Form (ICF).\n2. Women aged \u226518 and \u226470 years (at the time of signing ICF).\n3. Pathohistologically or cytologically documented unresectable advanced or metastatic breast cancer that is suitable for paclitaxel treatment, negative for HER2 amplification/overexpression as defined per the American Society of Clinical Oncology - College of American Pathologists (ASCO-CAP) guidelines (Appendix 1), and positive for estrogen receptor (ER) or progesterone receptor (PR).\n4. At least one measurable target lesion as defined by Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1.\n5. Anticipated life expectancy \u22653 months.\n6. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance score (PS) 0 to 1.\n7. Prior chemotherapy meeting the followings:\n\n   * The subject has received no or only 1 chemotherapy regimen (monotherapy or combined treatment) after relapse or metastasis;\n   * Prior adjuvant, neoadjuvant or first-line chemotherapy with taxanes, if any, has been discontinued for \\>12 months by the time of enrollment, and none of the prior therapies were discontinued due to progressive disease or toxicity.\n8. Prior endocrinotherapy meeting the followings:\n\n   The subject has received at least one endocrinotherapy regimen, alone or combined with CDK4/6 or mTOR inhibitors, and has experienced progressive disease or intolerability.\n9. Meeting the following criteria for laboratory tests (provided that there was no blood transfusion, use of G-CSF or use of drug for correction of, e.g., blood components, etc., within 14 days prior to the test):\n\n   Test Criterion Hematology Neutrophil count \u2265 1.5 \u00d710\\^9/L\n\n   Platelet count \u2265 100 \u00d710\\^9/L RBC count \u2265 90g/L Lymphocyte count \u22650.8\u00d710\\^9/L Biochemistry\n\n   Serum creatinine \u22641.5 \u00d7 upper limit of normal (ULN) and estimated creatinine clearance \u226540 mL/min (by Cockcroft -Gault formula, see Appendix 3) Albumin \u226530g/L Total bilirubin \u22641.5 \u00d7 ULN\n\n   AST and ALT \u2264 2.5 \u00d7 ULN (or \u22643.0 \u00d7 ULN in the presence of documented liver metastasis) Coagulation International Normalized Ratio (INR) or prothrombin time (PT)\n   * 1.5 \u00d7 ULN Activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT)\n   * 1.5 \u00d7 ULN Urinalysis (24h urine protein quantitation if necessary) Urine protein \u22641+; if \u22652+, 24h protein quantitation is required and should be \\<1.0g/24h\n10. Duration from the end of last non-study treatment to the first study treatment:\n\n    * Prior chemotherapy or other investigational product: \\>4 weeks or \\>5 half lives, whichever occurred later (or \\>4 weeks if the half life is unavailable)\n    * Surgical treatment or radiotherapy: \\>3 weeks\n    * Endocrinotherapy or small-molecular targeted therapy: \\>2 weeks\n11. Women of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test within 7 days prior to the first study treatment, be willing to use appropriate and reliable contraception throughout the treatment period and for 6 months after last study treatment, and be willing to undergo additional pregnancy tests during the study.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n1.

Known active, uncontrolled or symptomatic central nervous system (CNS) metastases, carcinomatous meningitis, or leptomeningeal disease as indicated by clinical symptoms, cerebral edema, and/or progressive growth. Subjects with CNS metastases treated with radiation therapy (WBXRT or SRS) are eligible if \\> 28 days following completion of XRT, they show stable disease on post-treatment MRI/CT, are off corticosteroids, and are neurologically stable.\n3. Patients who have not recovered from acute toxicities of previous therapy(ies), except treatment-related alopecia or stable sensory neuropathy \u2264 Grade 2 (CTCAE v5.0).\n4.

Positivity for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) with hepatitis B viral load (HBV-DNA) higher than the laboratory lower limit of detection, or positivity for anti-hepatitis C virus antibody (anti-HCV) with hepatitis C viral load (HCV-RNA) higher than the laboratory lower limit of detection, or positivity for anti-human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) antibody (anti-HIV), or positivity for treponema pallidum antibody.\n6. Patients with autoimmune diseases.\n7. A history of opportunistic infection within 1 year, presence of active, uncontrolled infection (clinically significant viral, bacterial, fungal or other infections), antibiotic or antiviral treatment given within 14 days prior to first study treatment.\n8.
