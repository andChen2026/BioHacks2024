However, patients receiving corticosteroids must have been on a stable dosage regimen for a minimum of 4 weeks prior to the first treatment with RAD001.

Symptomatic congestive heart failure of New York heart Association Class III or IV\n  2. unstable angina pectoris, symptomatic congestive heart failure, myocardial infarction within 6 months of start of study drug, serious uncontrolled cardiac arrhythmia or any other clinically significant cardiac disease\n  3. severely impaired lung function as defined as spirometry and DLCO that is 50% of the normal predicted value and/or 02 saturation that is 88% or less at rest on room air\n  4. uncontrolled diabetes as defined by fasting serum glucose \\>1.5 x ULN\n  5. active (acute or chronic) or uncontrolled severe infections\n  6. liver disease such as cirrhosis, chronic active hepatitis or chronic persistent hepatitis. Note: A detailed assessment of Hepatitis B/C medical history and risk factors must be done at screening for all patients. HBV DNA and HCV RNA polymerase chain reaction testing are required at screening for all patients with a positive medical history based on risk factors and/or confirmation of prior HBV/HCV infection.\n* A known history of HIV seropositivity\n* Impairment of gastrointestinal function or gastrointestinal disease that may significantly alter the absorption of RAD001 (e.g., ulcerative disease, uncontrolled nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, malabsorption syndrome or small bowel resection)\n* Patients with an active, bleeding diathesis\n* Female patients who are pregnant or breast feeding, or adults of reproductive potential who are not using effective birth control methods. If barrier contraceptives are being used, these must be continued throughout the trial by both sexes. Hormonal contraceptives are not acceptable as a sole method of contraception. (Women of childbearing potential must have a negative urine or serum pregnancy test within 7 days prior to administration of RAD001)\n* Patients who have received prior treatment with an mTOR inhibitor (sirolimus, temsirolimus, everolimus).\n* Patients with a known hypersensitivity to RAD001 (everolimus) or other rapamycins (sirolimus, temsirolimus) or to its excipients\n* History of noncompliance to medical regimens\n* Patients unwilling to or unable to comply with the protocol\n* Ongoing alcohol or drug addiction",
