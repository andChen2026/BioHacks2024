    "eligibilityCriteria": "Inclusion Criteria:\n\n1. Age \u2265 18 years.\n2. Histologically or cytologically confirmed breast cancer diagnosis\n\nwith metastatic disease. Patients without pathologic or cytologic\n\nconfirmation of metastatic disease should have unequivocal\n\nevidence of metastasis.\n\n3. Measurable disease, as per RECIST criteria (Therasse et al.\n\n2000). Measurable disease cannot be previously irradiated\n\nunless progression was documented. Measurable disease is\n\ndefined as: at least one lesion that can be accurately measured in\n\nat least one dimension \\[longest diameter to be recorded\\] as\n\n\\>20 mm with conventional techniques, or as \\>10 mm with spiral\n\ncomputed tomography (CT) scan. Disease must be measurable,\n\ni.e., bone-only disease or evaluable-only disease is not eligible.\n\n4. Patients with brain metastasis may participate if they:\n\n\u2022 have undergone appropriate treatment,\n\n* are at least 1 month post-treatment,\n* have no neurologic symptoms,\n* are not on steroids,\n* have a follow-up magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan that\n\ndemonstrates no residual active lesions, and\n\n* have no new untreated lesions.\n\n  5 The following prior therapies are allowed:\n* No prior chemotherapy in the metastatic setting. However,\n\npatients must have received prior adjuvant or neo-adjuvant\n\nchemotherapy.\n\n* Prior radiation therapy in either the metastatic or early-stage\n\nsetting, as long as \\<25% of the bone marrow has been\n\ntreated. Radiation therapy must be completed at least\n\n14 days prior to study registration, and all radiation-related\n\ntoxicities must be resolved to \u2264 grade 1 before the patient is\n\neligible for study inclusion.\n\n* Any number of hormonal therapies in the neo-adjuvant,\n\nadjuvant, or metastatic setting is allowed. Patients must\n\ndiscontinue hormonal therapy at least 1 week prior to starting\n\nstudy treatment.\n\n\u2022Prior bevacizumab administered \\>4 weeks before initiation of\n\nstudy treatment is allowed.\n\n6 HER2-negative status. Documentation of HER2 results must be\n\navailable at the time of study enrollment. HER2-negative is\n\ndefined as:\n\n* Immunohistochemical (IHC) 0 or IHC 1+ OR\n* Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) negative (defined by\n\nFISH ratio \\<2.2) OR\n\n* Silver in-situ hybridization (SISH) negative (defined by SISH\n\nratio \\<2.2).\n\nPatients with an IHC 2+ will need to be validated as HER2-negative\n\nby FISH.\n\n7 An Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance\n\nstatus of \\< or = to 2.\n\n8. Normal bone marrow function as defined by:\n\n* absolute neutrophil count (ANC) \\>1,500/\u03bcL;\n* platelets \\>100,000/\u03bcL;\n* hemoglobin \\>9 g/dL.\n\n  9 Normal hepatic function as defined by:\n* total bilirubin within normal institutional limits;\n* aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine\n\naminotransferase (ALT) \\<2.5 \u00d7 the institutional upper limit of\n\nnormal (ULN) for patients without liver metastasis; \\<5.0 \u00d7 ULN\n\nfor patients with liver metastasis.\n\n10. Normal renal function as defined by creatinine \\<1.5 \u00d7 ULN.\n\n11. Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) within institutional limits of\n\nnormal.\n\n12. International normalized ratio (INR) \\<1.5 or a prothrombin\n\ntime/partial thromboplastin time (PT/PTT) within normal limits.\n\nPatients receiving anti-coagulation treatment with an agent such\n\nas warfarin or heparin may be allowed to participate. The INR\n\nshould be measured prior to initiation of sorafenib, and for\n\npatients on warfarin, INR should be monitored at least weekly\n\nfollowing initiation of protocol treatment, until the INR is stable and\n\ntherapeutic.\n\n13. Life expectancy of \\>6 months.\n\n14. For women of childbearing potential, negative serum pregnancy\n\ntest within 7 days prior to starting treatment.\n\n15. For women of childbearing potential and men, agreement to use a\n\nmethod of contraception that is acceptable to their physician from\n\ntime of first signing the informed consent and for the study\n\nduration. Men should use adequate birth control for at least three\n\nmonths after the last administration of sorafenib. If a woman\n\nbecomes pregnant or suspects she is pregnant while participating\n\nin this study, she must agree to inform her treating physician\n\nimmediately. As applicable, patients must agree to discontinue\n\nbreast-feeding until at least 3 weeks after their last dose of study\n\ndrug.\n\n16. Recovery to \\< grade 1 toxicity due to prior therapy.\n\n17. Ability to understand and willingness to sign a written informed\n\nconsent document.\n\nExclusion Criteria\n\n1. More than one (\\>1) prior chemotherapy regimen.\n2. Treatment with chemotherapy, biologic agents, or targeted agents\n\n   within the previous 4 weeks.\n3. Previous treatment with sorafenib or ixabepilone.\n4. Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding.\n5. Neuropathy (motor or sensory) greater than grade 1.\n6. Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including (but not limited to)\n\n   ongoing or active infection \\>grade 2.\n7.

Concurrent hormonal therapy, chemotherapy other than\n\n   ixabepilone, or radiation treatments while on study as well as\n\n   treatment with other investigational agents while on study.\n10. Cardiac disease:\n\n    \u2022Congestive heart failure (CHF) greater than New York Heart Association\n\n    (NYHA) Class II (see Appendix B).\n    * Unstable angina (anginal symptoms at rest) or new onset angina\n\n      (i.e., began within the last 3 months).\n    * Myocardial infarction within the past 6 months.\n    * Cardiac ventricular arrhythmias requiring anti-arrhythmic therapy.\n11.
