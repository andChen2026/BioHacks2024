    "eligibilityCriteria": "Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Histologically or pathologically confirmed noninflammatory Triple-Negative invasive breast carcinoma (TNBC). The diagnosis of TNBC was defined below: the estrogen receptor and progesterone receptor negativity rates were less than 10%, and the human epidermal growth factor receptor type 2 (HER2) staining was 0 or 1+, and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) detected no HER2 gene amplification\n* Clinical stage IIA-IIIB\n* Patients must have measurable disease as defined by palpable lesion with caliper and/or a positive mammogram or ultrasound. Bilateral mammogram and clip placement is required for study entry. Baseline measurements of the indicator lesions must be recorded on the Patient Registration Form. To be valid for baseline, the measurements must have been made within the 14 days if palpable. If not palpable, a mammogram or MRI must be done within 14 days. If palpable, a mammogram or MRI must be done within 2 months prior to study entry. If clinically indicated, x-rays and scans must be done within 28 days of study entry.\n* Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group(ECOG) performance status 0 to 1 within 14 days of study entry\n* Signed informed consent\n* Adequate organ function within 2 weeks of study entry: Absolute bone marrow function (hemoglobin concentration of \u22658.0 g/dL, white blood cell count of \u22653000 cells per \u03bcL, absolute neutrophil count of \u22651500 cells per \u03bcL, platelet count of \u226570000 cells per \u03bcL), adequate renal function (creatinine was the upper limit of normal or lower), and adequate liver function (total bilirubin was the upper limit of normal or lower, and aspartate aminotransferase or alanine aminotransferase was twice the upper limit of normal or lower)\n* Patients must be aged 18-70 years\n* Women of childbearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test performed within 7 days prior to the start of treatment\n* Women of childbearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception (barrier method of birth control) prior to study entry and for the duration of study participation.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Metastatic disease\n* Prior chemotherapy, hormonal therapy, biologic therapy, investigational agent, targeted therapy or radiation therapy for current breast cancer. Patients with history of breast cancer greater than 5 years from initial diagnosis are eligible for the study. Patients may not have received anthracycline-based chemotherapy in the past. Patients with history of ductal carcinoma in situ(DCIS) are eligible if there were treated with surgery alone\n* History of previous or current malignancy at other sites with the exception of adequately treated carcinoma in-situ of the cervix or basal or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin. Patients with a history of other malignancies, who remain disease free for greater than five years are eligible\n* Uncontrolled blood pressure, previous exposure to apatinib, known allergies to any of the excipients, and a history of unstable angina, myocardial infarction, or class III/IV congestive heart failure (defined by the New York Heart Association) within the past 6 months before day 1 of the trial",
