    "eligibilityCriteria": "DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS:\n\n* At increased risk of developing breast cancer and enrolled on clinical trial CAN-NCIC-MAP3\n* Bone mineral density (BMD) (as measured by dual x-ray absorptometry \\[DEXA\\] scans within 12 months prior to randomization to the core protocol \\[MAP.3\\]) T score \\> -2.0 standard deviation (i.e., 2.0 standard deviations below the average peak BMD of a young adult woman) of spine (L1-L4) and total hip\n* Serum for bone biomarkers (i.e., serum N-telopeptide and serum amino-terminal procollagen 1 extension peptide) must have been obtained within 8 weeks prior to registration to the study\n\nPATIENT CHARACTERISTICS:\n\n* Postmenopausal, defined as one of the following:\n\n  * Over 50 years of age with no spontaneous menses for at least 12 months before study entry\n  * 50 years of age or under with no menses (spontaneous or secondary to hysterectomy) for at least 12 months before study entry AND with follicle-stimulating hormone level within postmenopausal range\n  * Underwent prior bilateral oophorectomy\n* Available for collection of serum samples and BMD (DEXA) scans at the protocol defined times (i.e., have BMD scans at years 2 and 5 at the same site)\n* No history of fragility fractures (i.e., a broken bone that occurs with a fall from a standing height or lesser amount of trauma)\n* No malabsorption syndrome (e.g., untreated celiac disease, clinically relevant vitamin D deficiency, or active hyper- or hypoparathyroidism)\n* No Paget disease or other metabolic bone diseases (e.g., osteomalacia or osteogenesis imperfecta)\n* No Cushing disease or other pituitary diseases\n* No inflammatory disease(s) (e.g., inflammatory bowel disease, rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, psoriasic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, or autoimmune hepatitis)\n\nPRIOR CONCURRENT THERAPY:\n\n* More than 3 months since prior bone drugs, such as bisphosphonates, teriparatide (parathyroid hormone \\[PTH\\]), sodium fluoride, calcitonin (Miacalcin\u00ae), strontium, or high-dose vitamin D (i.e., vitamin D3 \\> 2,000 IU/day or calcitriol)\n* No prior bisphosphonate therapy duration of more than 6 months total during lifetime\n* No concurrent anabolic or chronic oral corticosteroids (the equivalent of 5 mg of prednisone a day or higher for more than 2 weeks within the past 6 months and will likely require ongoing therapy)\n* Concurrent inhaled steroids allowed\n* No concurrent medication that may have an effect on study endpoints for this study, including any of the following:\n\n  * Anticonvulsants\n  * Sodium fluoride at daily doses \\> 5 mg/day for a period exceeding 1 month\n  * Anabolic steroids\n  * Teriparatide (parathyroid hormone)\n  * Bisphosphonates, except for women who develop osteoporosis while on this study; these patients may be advised to start bone medication (i.e., strontium, calcitonin, or high-dose Vitamin D (i.e., Vitamin D3 \\> 2000 IU/day or calcitriol) at the discretion of their physician",
